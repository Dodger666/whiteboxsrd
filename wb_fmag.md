## IntroductIon

When I discovered the OSR, I enjoyed every game I read, but one stood out
from the rest as the most versatile of games: Swords & Wizardry: WhiteBox.
It’s conciseness was a breath of fresh air after the volumnous and verbose trend
in modern fantasy role-playing games. But it had one problem, its presentation
left a lot to be desired. I waited for years to see an update, but it never hap-
pened. Finally, one day, I had waited long enough. If no one else was going to
update it, then I would do it myself. I had no experience in publishing and had
a decent understanding of MS Word. White Box: Fantastic Medieval Adven-
ture Game was born.

I have since gained some experience points and raised to level 2. I have also
formed some relationships with industry professionals. So when the time came
that I had to add some things to the game, I took advantage of my experience
and I spent some gold on a hireling to enhance the game’s presentation.

Your eyes now behold the result of that labor.

It is my sincere hope that you will find this version of the game easy to use and
simple to learn and that it will serve as the foundation for many great adven-
tures in the world of your imagination.

Good journey!

**mythIc maGIc Item**
The White Box
**Roll 1d6 Destination**
1 The land of Blackmarsh
2 The dungeons beneath Castle Grey
3 A magical house on a lake in Jeneve
4 The Green Tower on Chief ’s Hill
5 A land of faeries and talking animals
6 Anywhere you want. You are only limited by your imagination

The White Box was created by two men who were masters of eldritch sorcery.
They brought their powers together to create a magical artifact, that would
transport the users to other worlds of magic and wonder. It is said no one
knows what it is, until they hold it in their hands and discover the magic for
themselves. For some the box may appear to be made of wood and for others
it may even appear as a book.


White Box requires two kinds of participants: (1) The Referee and (2) the
Player. For Players, the first step in playing the game is to create a Player Char-
acter (PC). This is a simple matter of rolling some dice to determine your
character’s attributes, picking a character class, race (if non-human) and buy-
ing in-game equipment. If you’re the Referee, however, you’ve got a bit more
preparation to do—that’s covered in Chapter 7.

### Rule Number One

The most important rule in White Box is that the Referee always has the right
to modify the rules. In fact, it’s encouraged! This is your game, after all. There
are gaps in the rules—holes left open on purpose—because much of the fun of
role-playing games is being able to make up rules as needed.

# Chapter^1

## Getting^ Started


### Dice

White Box uses several different types of dice, and they are abbreviated herein
according to the number of sides they have. For example, a four-sided die is
noted as “d4.” If this text requires a player to roll “3d4” that means to roll three
(3) four-sided dice and add the results together. Other die types (six-sided,
eight-sided, ten-sided, twelve-sided, and twenty-sided) follow in the same
manner.

There is no die with 100 sides. When asked to roll d100, roll two (2) ten-sided
dice, treating the first roll as the “tens” and the second as the “ones.” So, if one
were to roll a “7” and then a “3”, the result would be “73.”

The roll of two zeroes is treated as a result of “100,” so you cannot roll a “0” on
percentile dice. The lowest result possible is a “1.”

### About the Optional Rules

White Box is very easy to learn and play. The rules are simple and clear. As you
create your character and read through the rules, you will see that there are
several “Optional Rules” described. These are for customizing the game to fit
the way you want to play, but if you are the Referee and this is your first time
running a game like this, stick with the basic rules and customize later. The
optional rules, plus any new rules that you and your group invent, are often
called “House Rules,” because each gaming group will use a different mix of
alternate and invented rules. This is a good thing, eventually you’re supposed
to customize your game to fit what you want, not to follow the “official” rules
forever and ever.


### Character Sheets

A character sheet is a piece of paper designed to organize and contain any and
all necessary PC information, for the benefit of both the Referee and Player.
For White Box, the character sheet could be something as simple as a 3x5”
index card—with equipment and spells written on the back. Or you can down-
load the sheet below at [http://whiteboxgame.blogspot.com/](http://whiteboxgame.blogspot.com/)


### Attributes

The basic attributes are numbers which represent the Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma of a character. The standard
way to create attribute scores is to roll 3d6 for each attribute in the previously
mentioned order. Once those rolls have been made, it is often obvious which
type of character best fits the abilities—though, the player always has the op-
tion to play any class desired. Once the player decides on a class, points from
other attributes may be shifted around (on a 1 for 1 basis), but only into the
“Prime Attribute” of that character class. Shifting points around may not lower
another ability score below 9, however.

Some Referees allow more flexibility
(optionally). One example is to let the
players roll 3d6 a total of six times and
arrange the rolls however they want.
This allows the player to put the best
results into abilities that best suit the
type of character the player wants to
be.

##### Attribute Modifier

White Box doesn’t give many modifiers for the range of attribute scores. You
can modify the game to change the effect that these scores have. Table 1 gives
the standard range and effects for attributes scores. Feel free to change the val-
ues. For example, if you prefer the “average” range to be 9–12, adjust the table.

### Experience Bonus

Each character may get a bonus percentage to their “experience points” (XP)
that will increase the amount of experience points gained during an adventure.
All characters add together the following: 5% if the character’s Prime Attribute
is 15+, 5% if Wisdom is 15+, and 5% if Charisma is 15+. A Cleric with Wis-
dom of 15+ gets the 5% bonus twice: once because it is the Prime Attribute for
a Cleric, and again because it is applied to all characters. The maximum attain-
able bonus is 15%. All awards of XP to the character during play will be in-
creased by the amount of the bonus (by 0%, 5%, 10%, or 15%, whichever it is).

An optional method for the experience point bonus is simply to give the char-
acter a bonus of 10% if the Prime Attribute is 15+, 5% if the Prime Attribute
is 13-14, and –10% if the Prime Attribute is lower than 9. There is no bonus
for scores between 9 and 12. If you use this method, do not also give the +5%
bonuses described in the basic rules that follow: if you do it this way, the maxi-
mum XP bonus is 10%.


Table 1: Attribute Bonus
Attribute
Roll
Description Modifier


3-6 Low -
7-14 Average 0
15-18 High +


##### Strength

Strength represents the character’s physical power. It is the Prime Attribute for
Fighters, so when a Fighter character has Strength of 15+, t he character gets a
5% bonus to XP. Fighters can use their Strength Bonus to modify their “to-hit”
and damage results when using melee weapons.

##### Intelligence

Intelligence represents knowledge, reasoning, and the ability to solve puzzles
or understand difficult concepts. A high Intelligence score gives a character an
additional language for every point above 10. Intelligence is the Prime Attri-
bute for Magic-users, who will get a 5% bonus to XP if the character’s Intel-
ligence is 15+. Magic-users can use their Intelligence Bonus to improve “spell
effectiveness” (i.e. target suffers a loss on his saving throw).

##### Wisdom

Wisdom determines a character’s insight, perception, and good judgment.
Wisdom is the Prime Attribute for Clerics. Any character with a Wisdom
score of 15+ gets a 5% bonus to XP, and a Cleric character with Wisdom 15+
gets another 5% (total of 10%) because it is the Prime Attribute for the Cleric
class. Clerics can use their Wisdom Bonus to improve “spell effectiveness” (i.e.
target suffers a loss on his saving throw).

##### Constitution

Constitution refers to the health and endurance of a character. A high Consti-
tution score (15+) gives the character a +1 to each hit die, and a low score (6 or
lower) gives a –1 penalty to each hit die.

##### Dexterity

Dexterity is a combination of coordination and quickness. It is the Prime At-
tribute for Thieves (if they are used). A high Dexterity score (15+) gives a
character a bonus on “to-hit” rolls when attacking with a bow or other ranged
weapon, and a low score (6 or less) gives a penalty of -1 to such rolls. Dexterity
can be used to modify a character’s
Armor Class.

##### Charisma

Charisma refers to a character’s
personal magnetism and leadership
ability. Any character with a Cha-
risma of 15+ receives a 5% bonus
to XP. Charisma also determines
the number of Non-Player Char-
acter (NPC) hirelings a character
can acquire. These hirelings include
specialists (ship captains, assassins,


Table 2: Charisma Modifier
Charisma Hirelings (Max #) Loyalty
3–4 1 -
5–6 2 -
7–8 3 -
9–12 4 0
13–15 5 +
16–17 6 +
18 7 +


etc.) and non-human creatures, but do not usually include basic soldiers. Cha-
risma modifies the loyalty of NPCs (See “Loyalty”).

### Hit Points

Hit points (HP) represent the amount of “damage” a character can take before
dying: they are determined by the number of hit dice (HD) the character has
at each level, which is found in the description of each character class later on.
If a player begins the game with a 1st level Fighter (1+1 HD) the player would
therefore roll 1 HD (1d6) and add “+1” to the end result to determine his PC’s
starting hit points. When the character accumulates enough XP to gain a level,
usually a new hit die is rolled and added to the total (sometimes a new level
only gives an additional hit point, though, not a whole new hit die).

### Alignment

Alignments in the game represent cosmic forces and are described as Law,
Chaos, and Neutrality. In general, Law also corresponds to being “good,” Chaos
corresponds to being “evil,” and Neutrality simply means that the character is
indifferent between the two moral polarities. It is quite possible for the Referee
to make the alignment system more complex: perhaps Lawful only means that
you are in favor of centralized hierarchies in society, in which case you could
actually be Lawful Evil as well as Lawful Good. It is a matter of preference if
you want to make the alignment system more complex.

### Character Retirement

If a character reaches the highest level listed on the table for that character
class, what happens? Does advancement stop? Does the character have to re-
tire? Each group has its own play style and a preference for a given range of
character levels for their games. If the Referee wants to extend the tables to
allow higher-level characters, then go for it!


# Chapter^2

## Charact

## er Classe

## s

There are four possible character classes in the game: the Cleric, the Fighter,
the Magic-user, and the Thief (optional). The Referee is, of course, free to in-
vent or allow other character classes in the game.


### The Cleric

Clerics are armored priests who
serve a particular alignment, reli-
gion, or patron deity. Players may
make up the details if the Referee
doesn’t use a particular mythology
for the campaign. Mythologies
and other details of a campaign
world often come later if the Ref-
eree is just starting.

The Cleric is a champion of his faith and
moral alignment. The character might be
a sinister witch-hunter, an exorcist of
demons, a shining knight of the faith,
or a secret agent of some temple hi-
erarchy. Since many of the Cleric’s
abilities are oriented toward healing
and protecting, they tend to play
a support role during combat.
However, they are able to stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with the
party’s Fighters if need be—at least
for a while. Clerics must be either Lawful (good) or
Chaotic (evil). There are no Neutral Clerics unless the Referee decides other-
wise.

##### Cleric Abilities

**Weapon and armor reStrIctIonS**
Because of secret religious practices, Clerics may only use blunt weapons (club,
flail, mace, etc.) and the only missile weapon they are allowed is oil. Clerics
have no armor restrictions.

**Spell caStInG**
Clerics cast divine spells from a specific spell list, as per the Cleric Advance-
ment table. Each day, the Cleric prays for a certain set of spells, choosing any
spells from the standard list. Clerics of specific gods might have entirely differ-
ent sets of spells as designed by the Referee, but the standard Cleric uses the
standard spell list.

**SavInG throW**
Clerics receive a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. poison and paralysis (unless the
alternative “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).


**turn the undead**
Clerics can use their divine power to banish the undead, causing them to flee.

**eStablISh temple**
At tenth level, the rank of “Patriarch” is awarded. A Cleric, who chooses to
build and dedicate a temple to a deity, may attract a body of loyal followers who
swear fealty to the character. If the Cleric changes alignment after establishing
a Temple, the character will lose any followers (and probably face a revolt).

**experIence bonuS for WISdom**
Wisdom is the Prime Attribute for Clerics. Clerics with Wisdom of 15 or
higher receive a 10% to experience, 5% as normal, and 5% because it is the
Prime Attribute for the class.

**turn the undead**
Lawful clerics (only) have the ability to turn the undead, causing them to flee
or destroying them outright. When a turning attempt is made, roll 3d6 and
consult the Turn Undead table for the result. One turn attempt may be made
per encounter.

If the result on the dice is equal to or greater than the number shown on the
table, all undead creatures of the targeted type are turned and will flee for 3d
rounds (or cower helplessly if they are unable to flee). Optionally, the Referee
may rule that only 2d6 HD are turned, starting with the lowest to highest.

For Lawfully aligned Clerics, if the table indicates a “D” then the undead crea-
ture is destroyed automatically and will crumble to dust.

**turn undead (varIant)**
Referees who wish to limit the use of the Turn Undead ability might try to
count this as merely a 1st level Cleric spell.

**chaotIc clerIcS and the undead (optIonal)**
Many Referees allow Chaotic clerics as well as Lawful clerics to turn the Un-
dead. If Chaotic clerics are allowed to turn the undead, treat a result of “D”
on the table a bit differently; instead of destroying the undead creature, the
Chaotic cleric has forced it into servitude. It will follow the character’s com-
mands, although the Referee will decide the limitations on this power. Perhaps
the cleric can only keep a certain number of undead under control at one time
(or a certain number of hit dice) – the cleric’s level is a good number to use for
this limit, whether it stands for a maximum number of Undead creatures or for
a maximum number of total hit dice.


### The Fighter

The Fighter is a warrior, trained in battle
and in the use of armor and weapons. Your
character might be a ferocious Viking raider,
a roaming samurai, or a medieval knight. Because
they are the best equipped of all the character
classes to deal out and absorb damage, Fighters
often end up on the front lines, going toe-to-toe
with dragons, goblins, and evil cultists. If you
are the party’s Fighter, the down-and-dirty
work is up to you.

##### Fighter Abilities

**Weapon and armor reStrIctIonS**
Fighters are trained in warfare and, as such, have no restrictions on the kind
of weapons or armor they can use.

**combat fury**
Against foes of one hit dice (HD) or fewer, Fighters get one attack
per level each combat round.

**SavInG throW**
Fighters receive a +2 bonus on
saving throws vs. death and poi-
son (unless the alternative “Saving
Throw Matrix” is used).

10 512,000 10 +6 5


**eStablISh StronGhold**
At ninth level, a Fighter who chooses to build a castle is considered to have
reached the rank of “Baron” or “Baroness,” bestowed by the local ruler or mon-
arch. The character may choose to attract a body of soldiers, who will swear
their fealty as loyal followers.

**experIence bonuS for StrenGth**
Strength is the Prime Attribute for Fighters, which means that a Strength
score of 15+ grants an additional 5% experience.


### The Magic-User

The Magic-user is a mysterious figure, a student of arcane powers and dark
magic. They can be devastating opponents. However, at lower levels, they are
quite vulnerable and must be protected by the other party members. As Mag-
ic-users progress, they generally become the most powerful of the character
classes—holding sway over the political destinies of great kingdoms and able
to create wondrous magical artifacts.

##### Magic-user Abilities

**Weapon and armor reStrIctIonS**
Magic-users tend to spend their waking hours in study of
arcane tomes and scrolls. As such, they have little time
to train with weapons or learn how to properly engage
in physical combat. Magic-users may only wield dag-
gers or staves, and are not allowed the use of armor.

**Spell caStInG**
Unlike the Cleric, the Magic-user owns a book of
spells—which does not necessarily include all of the
spells on the standard lists. Reading from this book,
the Magic-user presses a select spell formula into her
mind, effectively “preparing” it to be cast. Once a
prepared spell is cast, the spell formulae disappears
from the Magic-user’s mind, and must be prepared
again before another attempt can be made to cast
it. However, it is possible to prepare a spell mul-
tiple times using the available “slots” in the
Magic-user’s memory. If the Magic-user
finds spell scrolls during an adventure, she
can copy them into her spell book.

**SavInG throW**
Magic-users receive a +2 bonus on
saving throws vs. spells—including
those cast from wands and staves
(unless the Alternate “Saving
Throw Matrix” is used).

**experIence bonuS for IntellIGence**
Intelligence is the Prime Attribute for Magic-users, which means that an In-
telligence score of 15+ grants them an additional 5% to all experience points
awarded.


**eStablISh toWer**
At tenth level, a Magic-user gains
the title of “witch” or “wizard” and
can build a stronghold to house
her library and laboratory. She
will attract a mix of mercenaries,
strange servants and even a few
monsters (like flying monkeys).
This motley crew will swear fealty
to her and serve her with what-
ever loyalty she can inspire.

### The Thief

While there are many who wield sword and spell
while exploring tombs and dungeons, the thief
hopes to recover lost riches through the use of
guile and stealth. Though trained in arms, he is
not a combatant by trade. Instead he strikes from
the shadows and his keen eyes see dangers that
his companions do not. Thieves are rarely noble,
but are more often pragmatic professionals looking
for opportunities to rapidly amass great wealth.
Still, their unique skill set makes them very useful
to dungeoneers and explorers and there are some
among their ilk who hold to a code of “honor
among thieves.”

Thieves often go equipped with but a few
weapons and light armor, and rely on picks and
tools for survival. When combat does arise, they
fade into the darkness, ready to plunge a dagger into
the backs of unsuspecting foes. The rare thief who
manages to amass fortune and glory is likely to re-
tire and start a guild of others with similar
skills.

##### Thief Abilities

**WeaponS and armor reStrIctIonS**
Thieves are agile and skilled in combat. They may wield any weapon. However,
they prefer to rely on their reflexes and only wear leather armor.

**back Stab**
Any time a thief attacks an opponent who is unaware of their presence, the
thief receives a +2 to their Base Hit Bonus. If the attack is successful, the thief
may roll his weapon damage twice.

**SavInG throW**
Thieves receive a +2 bonus to any saving throw made to reduce or avoid the
effects of any trap, magical or mundane.

**thIevery**
Thieves are stealthy and light-footed. The thievery ability may be used for any
number of clandestine or stealth-based actions. From picking pockets or locks,
discovering and disarming traps, remaining silent and hidden while moving or
even climbing walls free-handed. The Referee has the final say as to whether an
action falls under the purview of thievery or not. When the thief attempts to use


this ability the Referee
rolls 1d6. If the result
of the roll is equal to or
lower than their rating
in the thievery ability,
the thief is successful in
their attempt. Thieves
are not often aware of
when their attempts to
remain stealthy fail, and
the thief always believes
he is successful.

**eStablISh GuIld:**
A thief of ninth or
higher level may choose
to establish a secret
hideout, often in an ur-
ban location. He will attract the attention and service of other, lower-leveled,
thieves who hope to learn from a master. He is known as a Guild Master, and
those who arrive are members of his Thieves Guild. In return for a cut of their
earnings, the thief will provide these apprentices with protection from local law
enforcement as much as he is able.

**experIence bonuS for dexterIty**
Dexterity is the Prime Attribute for Thieves, which means that a Dexterity
score of 15+ grants an additional 5% experience.

In a fantasy world, humans often aren’t alone. Elves may populate the great
forests, Dwarves may carve their halls and mines into the heart of the earth,
and Halflings may reside in the comfortable hill-houses of their bucolic shires.
By contrast, some fantasy worlds depict an isolated human race pitted against
ancient pre-human evils and the grim, savage wilderness of worlds at the dawn
(or dusk) of human civilization itself. Some fantasy worlds, as a third example,
accentuate the bizarre, with a wide variety of fantasy races available to the
players—such worlds are filled with conflict and contradictions, always with a
new wonder to be found beyond the next corner. The Referee determines what
non-human races, if any, you can choose for your character.

# Chapter^3

## Character^ Races


### The Dwarf

Dwarves tend to live in underground cities. As
such, Dwarves easily take note of certain fea-
tures of stonework: sloping corridors, moving
walls, and traps made of stone (in particular:
falling blocks, rigged ceilings, and tiny slits
designed to release arrows, darts, or poi-
son gas). What the Dwarf does or does
not perceive is for the Referee to de-
cide but for an optional die roll to
use, see the Keen Detection racial
ability.

##### Dwarven Abilities

**character advancement**
Dwarfs can choose between two classes, the Fighter or Thief (if used), and they
are typically allowed to advance as high as 6th level.

**Weapon and armor reStrIctIonS**
Like human Fighters, Dwarves have been trained in warfare and have no re-
strictions on the weapons or armor they may use.

**fIGhtInG GIantS**
Giants, ogres, and similar giant-type creatures such as trolls are not good at
fighting dwarves, and only inflict half the normal damage against them.

**keen detectIon**
Dwarves are good at spotting traps, slanting passages, and construction while
underground (1-4 on a d6 when searching, 1-2 on a d6 if just passing by).

**SavInG throW**
Dwarves do not use magic and are somewhat immune to its effects; they re-
ceive a +4 bonus on saving throws vs. magic (whether or not the alternate “Sav-
ing Throw Matrix” is used).

**lanGuaGeS**
For campaigns that give each race its own dialect, Dwarves should be able to
speak with gnomes, goblins, orcs, and kobolds.


### The Elf

The Referee can interpret Elves in many dif-
ferent ways. Are they faerie-folk of Irish leg-
end, the Vanir of Norse mythology, or perhaps
something more akin to the Elves of Tolkien’s
imagination?

As a baseline, most Elves are associated with
magic as well as being skilled with the sword
and bow. The Elven adventurer may choose,
on any given day—perhaps when the moon
rises—whether to use the capabilities of
the Fighter or Magic-user. As a result,
the Elf has two alternate advancement
paths (experience points, hit dice, sav-
ing throws, “to-hit” bonuses, etc.) de-
pending upon whether he donned steel
that day or summoned up the power to cast spells.

Elves must use a spell book to prepare spells, just as a Magic-user. Spells disap-
pear from his casting capability once they are cast, until prepared again.

##### Elven Abilities

**character advancement**
Elves may use either the Fighter or Magic-user class advancement charts, to be
announced at the start of an adventure. They are typically allowed to progress
to 4th level as Fighters and 8th as Magic-users.

**Weapon and armor reStrIctIonS**
When an Elf adventures as a Magic-user, the character has the same weapon
and armor limitations as a Magic-user. The exception to this would be magic
armor, which may still be worn even when the Elf is acting as a Magic-user.

**heredItary foeS**
Elves gain an extra +1 (“to-hit” or to damage) when fighting goblins, orcs, in-
telligent undead, and lycanthropes. Elves are also immune to paralysis caused
by undead such as ghouls.

**keen detectIon**
Elves are good at spotting hidden and concealed doors (1-4 on a d6 when
searching, 1-2 on a d6 if just passing by).


**lanGuaGeS**
For campaigns that give each race its own dialect, Elves should be able to speak
with gnolls, goblins, orcs, and hobgoblins.

## The Elf (Variant)

Some Referees may want to allow the Elf to advance as a blend of Fighter and
Magic-user instead of switching back and forth. In that model, the following
advancement table might be used instead. Aside from Character Advancement
and Weapon and Armor Restrictions, Elven Race Abilities remain the same.

8 320,000 5 +2 7 4 2 2

**Weapon and armor reStrIctIonS**
Elves would have the advantage of both magic and armor at the same time, so
the Referee may limit the Elf to chain mail. Elves may not use two-handed
weapons (two-handed sword, polearms, etc.) or shields while casting spells.


### The Halfling

Halflings are short, often stout, and live in shires, rustic communities that are
usually remote from those of larger folk. A few of them have a mildly adven-
turous spirit, enough to venture forth for a while at least, exploring the world
beyond the farms and fields of the local shire.

##### Halfling Abilities

**character advancement**
Halflings can choose between two classes, the Fighter or Thief (if used) and
they are typically allowed to advance as high as 4th as a fighter and 6th as a
thief.

**Weapon and armor reStrIctIonS**
Like human Fighters, the Halfling has no weapon or armor restrictions.

**fIGhtInG GIantS**
Giants, ogres, and similar giant-type creatures such as trolls are not good at
fighting small creatures such as halflings and dwarves, and only inflict half the
normal damage against them.

**deadly accuracy WIth mISSIleS**
Halflings receive a +2 “to-hit” when firing missile weapons in combat.

**near InvISIbIlIty**
When not engaged in combat, Halflings can be quite stealthy, making them-
selves hard to spot and moving in almost total silence. The success of this abil-
ity is determined by the Referee, or a die roll can be used, with a roll of 1-5 on
a d6 indicating success.

**SavInG throW**
Halflings are somewhat immune to magic,
and receive +4 on saving throws vs. magic
(even if the “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

**lanGuaGeS**
For campaigns that give each race its
own dialect, Halflings should be able to
speak with creatures that fit the style
of the Referee’s campaign.



Each character begins the game with 3d6x10 gold pieces, which is used to buy
equipment. One gold piece (gp) is worth 10 silver pieces (sp) or 100 copper
pieces (cp). Prices for equipment are listed on the tables below in the amount
of gold pieces. The Referee is encouraged to include additional items and
equipment.

### Equipment Weight


A “normal” level of miscellaneous equipment is assumed to weigh 10 pounds.
If treasure is added to this, each coin and gem is assumed to weigh 0.1 pound.

### Weapon Damage


In the original game, all weapons did 1d6 damage, regardless of type. White
Box provides some slight variation. To play the original game as it was written,
simply ignore all variations in weapon damage – they all inflict 1d6 damage
regardless of whether the weapon is a two-handed sword or a dagger.

##### Important

Numbers for the “Ascending” armor class system always appear in brackets
[like this].

### Calculating Armor Class

To calculate a character’s Armor Class, you must decide which system to use.
The two systems have the same armor protection, but in one of them a high
armor class is better, and in the other a low armor class is better. Just decide
which you prefer:

##### Descending AC System

In this system, an unarmored human has an AC of 9. The armor you buy low-
ers your AC and the lower the AC, the harder you are to hit. To calculate your
Armor Class, look at the Armor table above, in the “Effect on...” column. For
whatever type of armor you bought, subtract the number shown from your base
AC of 9. That’s your new Armor Class.

##### Ascending AC System

For the ascending system, an unarmored person has an AAC of [10]. AAC
means “ascending armor class,” and it is used in brackets as a reminder of which
system is in use. Your armor adds to your AAC, so the higher your AAC, the
harder it is for your enemies to hit you. To calculate your Ascending Armor
Class, look at the Armor table, in the “Effect on...” column. For whatever type
of armor you bought, add the number shown in brackets to your base AAC of
[10]. That’s your new Armor Class.

##### Converting Armor Class Systems

To translate between the Ascending and Descending AC systems, the ascend-
ing armor class (AAC) and descending armor class (AC) values should add up
to 19. Thus, AC 7 is the same as AAC [12] (12+7=19).

### Hiring Assistants

Many characters, particularly when first starting an adventuring career, are in
need of hirelings to assist in carrying loot or fighting monsters. Characters are
free to create advertisements and inquire at local taverns to find available hire-
lings. Prices are in gold pieces and are for one week of service.

These rates are for humans only. Demi-humans cost more to hire—and it may
take more than just the promise of gold coins.

Once characters have been created, the Referee will describe where the charac-
ters are and what they can see. The game might start in a rural peasant village,
a vast and teeming city spiked with towers and minarets, a castle, a tavern, or
at the gates of an ancient tomb. From that point on, Players describe what
their characters do. Going down stairs, attacking a dragon, talking to other
Player Characters (PCs) or Non-Player Characters (NPCs) controlled by the
Referee —all of these kinds of actions are decided by the players. The Referee
then describes what happens as a result: the stairs lead down to a huge tomb,
the dragon attacks the characters, etc. The rules below are guidelines handling
events like combat, gaining experience, movement, healing, dying, and other
important parts of the game.

Basically, the player and the Referee work together, with the Referee handling
the details of a dangerous fantasy world, and the player handling what their
character does in it. The epic story of a character’s rise to greatness (or death in
the effort) is the player’s to create in the Referee’s world.

the (^) Gam

## e


### Gaining Experience

Characters are awarded Experience Points (XP) for killing monsters and ac-
cumulating treasure. When enough XP is earned, the character raises a level.
Monsters have set Experience Point values in their descriptions, and one gold
piece acquired is equal to one XP. Experience is awarded for accumulating trea-
sure because every gold piece gained by a character is an index of his player’s
skill. Awarding experience only for killing monsters fails to reward a party of
adventurers that successfully lures a dragon away from its hoard so that its trea-
sure can be stolen without a fight— it fails to reward characters that operate by
intelligence, stealth, trickery, and misdirection.

Each character class has a Prime Attribute listed in its
description, and the character creation process details
how to determine the character’s total XP bonus. There
are two different ways of doing it, but each one results
in a percent bonus. If a character’s bonus is 10%, for
example, and the Referee awards 1000xp
to each character, that particular
character would get 1100xp (10%
of 1000 is 100, so the character
gets a bonus of 100xp).

### Time

The Referee will be required to make general rulings on the passage of time
during the course of a campaign (e.g. “A few hours later...”) and should be gov-
erned by common sense. There are, however, two important time measurements
that merit brief definitions--the “turn” and “combat round.” A turn (lasting ten
minutes) is used to track and measure
actions, movement and resources when
the intrepid adventurers are in danger-
ous places. The shorter combat round
(lasting one minute) represents the back
and forth action of battle.

### Movement

Base movement rate for all races is cal-
culated on the table below in tens of
feet per turn, allowing for two
moves per turn.

Careful movement is used for
exploring, checking for traps
and hidden things. Running
movement is used when you are
trying to get somewhere fast or

get away from something wicked. Normal movement is pretty much every-
thing else.

Combat movement is used when characters are engaged in battle and time has
transitioned to Rounds instead of Turns.

### Outdoor Movement

Base movement rate is in miles per day, but can be doubled during a forced
march. For outdoor combat round movement rates, take the base rate, divide
by three and multiply by 10 yards. For example a base movement rate of 9
normally allows 9 miles of travel per day, 18 miles forced, and 30 yards of
movement per combat round. The Referee should decrease the normal rate of
movement for travel over difficult terrain, like swamps or mountains.

### Dungeon Doors


Dungeon doors are large, heavy
and even unlocked are hard to
open. Humans and Elves will
open an unlocked door on a
roll of 1-2 in 6, while Dwarves
and Halflings have a base 1
in 6 chance. At the Referee’s
option, characters will apply
any strength bonus or penalty
to this roll. It is assumed that
most monsters can easily open
doors, and that once opened,
doors will shut on their own.


### Light


Torches and lanterns illuminate a 30-foot radius. Torches
burn for one hour (six turns), while lanterns burn one pint
of oil in four hours (24 turns). Players using a light source
cannot normally surprise monsters, but they can of course
still be surprised. It is assumed that all monsters see in the
dark, unless they are charmed or otherwise in the service
of players.

### Listening at Doors

Humans have a 1 in 6 chance of hearing noise, non-humans hear noise on a
roll of 1-2 in 6. Note that success indicates the player heard something, but
they may not know what caused the sound.

### Secret Doors

Secret doors can be detected by any player who is actively searching for one
with a roll of 1-2 on a d6. Elves, however, find secret doors on a roll of 1-4 on
a d6 when searching, or may sense with a 1-2 on a d6 chance that something
is amiss by merely passing by a secret door. It takes one turn for each 10’x10’
area searched.

### Traps

Most traps and pits are triggered on a roll of 1-2
on a d6 when any player passes over the trigger-
ing mechanism. Note that Dwarves can detect
stonework traps similarly to how Elves detect
secret doors - they have a 1-4 on a d6 chance to
detect such traps if actively searching, or 1-2 in 6
if merely passing by. Players falling into a pit trap
will take 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.

##### Note on finding secret doors and traps


Ideally, players will be descriptive enough dur-
ing a search that they will automatically find
a trap or secret door. For example, if moving a
wall sconce opens a secret door, and the player
says “I examine the sconces on the north wall
for anything unusual”, a Referee might auto-
matically allow them to figure out how the se-
cret door opens. If, however, they merely state
“I search the north wall for secret doors”, the
Referee can require a die roll. Some features
might be so well hidden as to always merit
a die roll, or at least a roll with some sort of
adjustment.


### Combat

When the party of adventurers comes into contact with enemies, the order of
events in the combat round is as follows:

1) The Referee determines if one side or the other is entitled to a free attack
or move as a result of surprise—this is either a judgement or a die roll of some
kind, depending on the circumstances. Normally, anyone is surprised if they
roll a 1 or a 2 on a d6.

2) Determine initiative. One roll is made for each side, not for each individual
in combat.


 Party with initiative acts first (missile fire, casting spells, movement, melee at-
tacks, etc.) and results take effect.


 Party that lost initiative acts; results take effect.


 The round is complete; roll initiative for the next round if the battle has not
been resolved.

### Intent

Some Referees prefer to have all parties make a “statement of intent” before
they roll initiative in order to force players to decide what they’re doing before
they know who goes first.

### How Initiative Works

At the beginning of the combat
round, each side rolls initiative on
a d6—high roll wins. The winning
side acts first, casting spells,
moving, and attacking. The
other side takes damage
and casualties, and then has
its turn.

Initiative rolls may result in a tie.
When this happens, both sides are considered to be acting simultaneously. The
Referee may handle this situation in any way he chooses—with one caveat.
The damage inflicted by the combatants during any simultaneous initiative is
inflicted even if one of the combatants dies during the round. It is possible for
two combatants to kill each other in this situation. If you want to play things
more simply, just re-roll initiative if there is a tie until one side or the other
wins the initiative.


###### Alternate Combat Sequence

The sequence of battle is one of the most commonly house-ruled parts of the
game. Here is one possibility, also based on the Original Game:


 Roll for surprise. Anyone not surprised gets a free round of combat in the
normal order (see below). If neither side, or both sides, are surprised, move on to
the next step.


 Roll for initiative (one roll for each whole side), and follow the sequence de-
scribed:

First, any “prepared” spells are cast. It takes a full combat round to prepare a
spell, but one can be prepared ahead of time. Spellcasters who won the initia-
tive cast their spells first. They may then start preparing a spell for the next
round, if desired.

Next, missile weapons are fired (if the bow was already in the character’s hands
and ready to go). This also happens in order of initiative.

Then melee combat takes place, in order of initiative. Finally, movement takes
place, in order of initiative.

If it is important to find out which character in the party goes before another
one, just compare their Dexterity scores to see which is higher.


###### The Attack Roll

To attack with a weapon, the player rolls a d20 and adds any
bonuses to the result. These “to-hit” bonuses may include
a strength bonus (for attacks with hand held weapons), a
dexterity bonus (for attacks with missile weapons), and any
bonuses for magic weapons. The player then subtracts any
“to-hit” penalties they might have from their roll.

The attack roll is then compared to a table to see if the attack hits. If the attack
roll is equal to or higher than the number on the table, the attack hits. If you
are using the Ascending AC system, rather than refer to these tables, there is
a quick method presented below that you can use. The Referee decides which
will be used.

If an attack hits, it inflicts damage (as determined by the weapon’s damage die).
The damage is subtracted from the defender’s hit point total (See “Damage and
Death”).

###### Ascending AC Combat

If you’re using the Ascending AC system, it may be easier to calculate your
“to-hit” rolls according to a simple formula. The numbers are the same as the
Descending AC tables—this is just a different way of calculating the results.
Here’s how it’s done:

To attack with a weapon, the player rolls a d20 and adds any bonuses to the
result. These “to-hit” bonuses now include the character’s Base “to-hit” Bonus,
as shown on the character Class table, and may include a strength bonus (for
attacks with handheld weapons), a dexterity bonus (for attacks with missile
weapons), and any bonuses for magic weapons. The player then subtracts any
“to-hit” penalties they might have from their roll. If the result is equal to or
greater than the opponent’s Ascending AC, the attack hits.

Note: This quick system only works for the ascending AC system. In order to
use this system, you’ll need to write down your Base “to-hit” Bonus, and adjust
it as you gain levels, but after doing that, you won’t have to check the table to
see if you score a hit. All you need to know is whether the total result was equal
to or higher than the target’s armor class.

###### Damage and Death


When a character (or creature) is hit, the amount
of damage taken is deducted from his hit points.
When hit points reach 0, the character dies.


##### A Less Harsh Method (optional)

Referees have different ideas concerning how lethal a game should be. For this
reason, many allow characters to become “unconscious” at 0 HP, with death
staved off until the character reaches some predetermined negative number.

For example, many Referees employ a house rule which allows a character’s
HP to fall below 0 by as many points as their level before the character dies; a
4th level character might die only if he falls below -4 HP. Generally, though, a
character with fewer than 0 HP is considered to be bleeding to death at 1 HP
per round until the wounds are bound up.

###### Healing

In addition to the various magical means of restoring HP, a character will
recover 1 full Hit point per day of uninterrupted rest. Four weeks of rest will
restore all of a character’s HP—regardless of how many the character lost.


###### Binding Wounds

Referees can allow characters to bind 1d6 HP worth of wounds following a
battle. This is of particular use in low-magic campaigns or in adventures where
none of the Players has chosen to run a Cleric.

Note that the character can only recover HP lost during this particular battle.
Recovered HP cannot cause a character to have more hit points than normal.

Some Referees view hit points as an abstract measurement of a character’s
stamina with the attack that brings a character to zero hit points representing
an actual significant blow from a weapon. As such, they may allow characters
to heal more hit points per day of rest.

###### Invisible Opponents

An invisible opponent can only be attacked if its general location is known,
and the attack suffers a -4 penalty “to-hit.” Note that more powerful monsters
(those with sensitive smell, hearing, or those with more than 6 HD) will fre-
quently be able to detect invisible opponents; the Referee should determine the
chance of this based on the creature and the situation.

###### Oil

Thrown oil that is subsequently set alight by a thrown torch or similar will
burn for two rounds, doing 1d6 damage per round on a successful hit of AC
8 [11]. The Referee should adjust the chance to hit based on the size of the
creature being targeted, obviously large creatures such as Ogres and Giants will
be easier to hit than, say, giant spiders.

##### Melee Attack

A melee attack is an attack with a hand-held weapon such as a sword, spear,
or dagger. Two combatants within ten feet of each other are considered to be
“in melee.”

##### Missile Attack

Missile attacks are with ranged weapons such as crossbows, slings, or thrown
axes. When using missiles to fire into melee, it is not possible to choose which
opponent (or friend!) will receive the brunt of the attack.

###### Morale

Certain monsters, such as mindless or undead creatures, are fearless and will
always fight to the death. The majority, however, will not continue to fight a
hopeless battle and will seek to retreat, surrender, or flee. The Referee will de-
cide when monsters abandon battle and retreat, based upon the situation and
the monster’s intelligence. Referees should also use morale to determine the
actions and loyalty of hirelings or other companion NPCs.


If there is uncertainty about the morale of
NPC’s or monsters, the following table can
be used at the Referee’s option.

###### Negotiation and Diplomacy

Some combats can be averted with a few
well-chosen words (even lies). If the party
is outmatched, or the monsters don’t seem
likely to be carrying much in the way of loot,
the party might elect to brazen their way
through in an attempt to avoid combat or at
least delay it until more favorable conditions
arise.

###### Jousting

A joust is a contest in which two
fighters ride at one another while
wielding lances. The object is to
make contact with the opponent’s
armor or shield that is hard enough
to break the lance or to actually un-
horse your opponent.

The joust, as a sport, consisted of three tilts. In White Box, this equates to three
rounds of combat. Each round consists of an attack with a lance. If the lances
are blunted, they deal 1d6-1 points of damage, but cannot kill the jouster. At 0
hit points, the jouster is knocked unconscious and falls from his steed (no ad-
ditional damage). If the lances are not blunted, they deal normal damage and
might kill.

Any jouster that suffers damage must pass a Saving Throw or be knocked from
his steed and suffer 1d6 damage from the fall.

Medium war horses grant a +1 bonus to attack. Heavy war horses grant a +2.

The jouster with the most points after three rounds wins the joust. If one op-
ponent is knocked unconscious or killed, they automatically lose the joust.

In a duel, the loser must forfeit his mount and his armor, and permit himself
to be ransomed for as much as his companions or family can pay, usually com-
mensurate with the fighter’s social class.

###### Spells

Spell casting begins at the start of the com-
bat round. It is possible to prepare a spell
while within melee range of an opponent
(10 feet) but if the caster suffers damage
while preparing a spell, the spell is lost. Un-
less stated otherwise, the spell is cast (takes
effect) in the caster’s initiative phase.

Note that in the Alternative Sequence of
Combat, spell casting works differently. In
that system, it takes a full round to prepare
a spell, the spell is cast at the beginning of
the round before anything else happens, and
the caster may spend the rest of the round
preparing a new spell (or doing something
else such as moving or even fighting).

###### Loyalty


The Referee may wish to make “loyalty
checks” for NPCs put into dangerous
situations or ones offered bribes to
change sides during a conflict. When
a loyalty check is made, roll 3d6 and
consult the Loyalty table for the result.
Remember that these checks can be
modified by a Player’s Charisma score.

Good treatment, respect, and a fair
share of treasure earned should garner
bonuses to loyalty checks, while abuse,
physical or otherwise, will bring about penalties, abandonment, or worse.
NPCs should be treated as distinct individuals, and not mere extensions of the
Player Character.

If an NPC is in a situation in which a Morale check may be appropriate, the
Loyalty modifier can be applied to the Morale roll (optional).

###### Saving Throws

From time to time, a spell or some other kind of hazard requires you to make
a “saving throw.” A successful saving throw means that the character avoids a
threat or lessens its effect. Each character class has a saving throw target num-
ber which gets lower as the character gains levels. To make a saving throw, roll
a d20. If the result is equal to or greater than the character’s saving throw target
number, the saving throw is successful.


Table 22: Loyalty
Roll Loyalty
3 Traitor
4–5 -2 on next loyalty check
6–8 -1 on next loyalty check
9–12 Average
13–15 +1 on next loyalty check
16–17 +2 on next loyalty check
18 Loyalist


##### Alternate Rule: The Saving Throw Matrix

The White Box saving throw system is an adaptation of the original, which
had several categories of different risks instead of a single basic saving throw as
used here. Numbers inspired by the original system are given below (the Single
Saving Throw number is provided for comparison):

This table does not integrate directly into White Box: if you were to house-
rule it in, you would have to eliminate the White Box class bonuses on saving
throws (i.e., the bonuses listed for each class in the class description but not
racial bonuses for non-humans).


##### Remember

White Box is a free-form roleplaying game, meaning that there aren’t very
many rules. The Referee is responsible for handling situations that aren’t cov-
ered by the rules, making fair evaluations of what the characters do and de-
ciding what happens as a result. This is not a game in which the players are
“against” the Referee, even though the Referee is responsible for creating tricky
traps, dangerous situations, and running the monsters and other foes the PCs
will encounter during the game. In fact, the players and the Referee cooperate
with each other to create a fantasy epic, with the Referee creating the setting
and the players developing the story of the heroes. If they aren’t skillful and
smart, the epic might be very short. But it’s not the Referee’s job to defeat
the players—it’s his job to provide interesting (and dangerous) challenges, and
then guide the story fairly.


Clerics and Magic-Users are the only classes that can cast spells. Spells have
three phases. First they are memorized (a character can only memorize a cer-
tain number of spells to bring along on an adventure – see the description
of the character classes to find out how many, and what level). Second, they
are prepared, which is the process of saying the magic words and making the
magic gestures. Third, the spell is cast, which means it takes effect and the
magic happens. In the normal sequence of combat, the caster starts preparing
at the beginning of the round and casts the spell whenever his/her side has the
initiative. In the alternative combat sequence, it takes a whole round to prepare
a spell, but spells are cast at the beginning of the next round, and the caster can
then take other actions during the round, including preparing a spell for the
next round.

Charm Monster

_Level:_ M4
_Range:_ 60 ft.
_Duration:_ Until dispelled

This spell operates in the same man-
ner as Charm Person, but can affect
more powerful monsters. Up to 3d6
monsters of fewer than 3 HD are af-
fected.

Charm Person

_Level:_ M1
_Range:_ 120 ft.
_Duration:_ Until dispelled

This spell affects living bipeds of hu-
man size or smaller, such as goblins
or dryads. If the spell succeeds (saving
throw allowed), the unfortunate crea-
ture falls under the caster’s influence.

Cloudkill

_Level:_ M5
_Range:_ Close
_Duration:_ 1 hour

Foul and poisonous vapors boil from
the thin air, forming a cloud 15 feet
in radius. The cloud moves away from
the caster at a rate of 6 feet per minute
unless its direction or speed is affected
by winds. Unusually strong gusts can
dissipate and destroy it. Poison-laden,


the horrid mist is heavier than air, and
thus sinks down any pits or stairs in
its path. This spell affects only crea-
tures with 5 or fewer HD.

Commune


Level: C5
Range: Caster
Duration: 3 questions


Higher powers grant answers to three
questions the caster poses. Higher
powers don’t like being constantly
interrogated by mere mortals, so the
spell should be limited to one casting
per week. The Referee may rule that
a caster may cast a double strength
Commune spell composed of six
questions once per year.

Confusion


Level: M4
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: 2 hours


This spell confuses people and mon-
sters, making them act randomly. The
effects of the confusion may shift ev-
ery 10 minutes, and the dice are rolled
again to determine any change. Roll
2d6 to determine the creature’s be-
havior:



Table 29: Confusion Reaction


Roll Reaction


2–5 Attack the caster (and his allies)
6–8 Stand baffled and inactive
9–12 Attack each other

The spell affects 2d6 creatures, plus
an additional creature for every caster
level above 8th. Creatures of 3 HD
or fewer are automatically affected by
the spell, and it takes effect immedi-
ately. Creatures of 4 HD or more au-
tomatically resist the confusion effect
until it reaches its full power, which
takes a number of minutes equal to
1d4. These creatures must make a sav-
ing throw when the effect reaches full
power and every 10 minutes there-
after or become confused for the re-
mainder of the spell’s duration.

Conjure Elemental

_Level:_ M5
_Range:_ 240 ft.
_Duration:_ Until dispelled

The caster summons a 16 HD ele-
mental (any kind) from the elemental
planes of existence, and binds it to his
commands. Each type of elemental
may only be summoned once per day.
The elemental obeys the caster only
for as long as the caster concentrates
on it; when the caster ceases to con-
centrate, even for a moment, the el-
emental is released and will attack.

Contact Other Plane

The caster creates a mental contact
with the planes, forces, powers, and
geometries of the beyond, in order to
gain affirmative or negative answers
to the questions he contemplates. The
spell’s effect depends on how deeply
the caster wishes to delve into the
planes of existence. Roll a d20 on the
table below.

 As a Detect Chaos spell, the
caster detects creatures of Chaos, or
those with chaotic enchantments,
intentions, thoughts, or auras with-
in the spell’s range. Poison is not in-
herently evil or chaotic and cannot

cept that it detects Law.

Dimensional Portal


Level: M4
Range: 10 ft. casting, 360 ft. teleport
Duration: Instantaneous


Dimensional Portal is a weak form of
the Teleport spell that can be man-
aged by lesser magicians. The caster
can teleport himself, an object, or
another person with perfect accuracy
to the stated location, as long as it is
within the spell’s given range.


Disintegrate

_Level:_ M6
_Range:_ 60 ft.
_Duration:_ Permanent

The caster defines one specific target
such as a door, a peasant, or a statue,
and it disintegrates into dust. Magical
materials are not disintegrated, and
living creatures (such as the afore-
mentioned peasant) are permitted a
saving throw. The Disintegrate spell
cannot be dispelled.

Dispel Chaos (Law)

_Level:_ C5
_Range:_ 30 ft.
_Duration:_ 10 minutes


 As a Dispel Chaos spell, the spell
is similar to the arcane spell Dispel
Magic, but works against items,
spells, or agents of Chaos. However,
unlike Dispel Magic, this spell also
functions against chaotic sendings,
possibly including dreams or super-
natural hunting-beasts.


 As a Dispel Law spell, the spell
works exactly like Dispel Chaos, ex-
cept that it will dispel Law.

Dispel Magic


Level: M3
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: 10 min.


Dispel magic can be used to com-
pletely dispel most spells and en-
chantments.


As an example of how one might
referee this spell, the chance of dis-
pelling magic could be a percentage
based on the ratio of the level of the
caster trying to dispel over the level
of the caster (or HD of the monster)
who hurled the original magic.


Thus, a 6th level Magic-user attempt-
ing to dispel a charm cast by a 12th
level Magic-user has a 50% chance of
success (6 / 12 = 1/2). If the 12th level
Magic-user were dispelling the 6th
level Magic-user’s charm, the dispel-
ling caster’s chance of success would
be 200% (12 ∕ 6 = 2).

Feeblemind


Level: M5
Range: 240 ft.
Duration: Permanent until dispelled


Feeblemind is a spell that affects
only Magic-users. The saving throw
against the spell is made at a -4 pen-
alty, and if the saving throw fails, the
targeted Magic-user becomes feeble-
minded until the magic is dispelled.


Find Traps

_Level:_ C2
_Range:_ 30 ft.
_Duration:_ 20 min.

Find Traps can allow the caster to
perceive both magical and non-magi-
cal traps at a distance of 30 feet.

Fireball

_Level:_ M3
_Range:_ 240 ft.
_Duration:_ Instantaneous

A missile shoots from the caster’s fin-
ger to explode at the targeted location
in a furnace-like blast of fire. It has a
burst radius of 20 feet and damage is
1d6 per level of the caster. The blast
shapes itself to the available volume.
A successful saving throw means that
the target only takes half damage.

Fly


Level: M3
Range: Touch
Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/level


This spell grants the power of flight,
with a movement rate of 120 feet per
round. The Referee rolls for the du-
ration of the spell in secret and does
not disclose this information to the
Player.

Hallucinatory Terrain


Level: M4
Range: 240 ft.
Duration: Until touched by an enemy
or dispelled


This spell changes the appearance of
the terrain into the semblance of what
the caster desires. A hill can be made
to disappear, or could be replaced with
an illusory forest, for example.


Hold Monster

_Level:_ M5
_Range:_ 120 ft.
_Duration:_ 1 hour + 10 minutes per
level

The caster can target either 1d4 crea-
tures (saving throw applies) or may
instead target a single creature who
must make their save at a -2 penalty.

Hold Person

_Duration:_ 90 min. (C), 1 hour + 10
minutes per level (M)

The caster can target either 1d4 per-
sons of human size or smaller (saving
throw applies) or may instead target a
single creature who must make their
save at a -2 penalty.

Hold Portal

_Level:_ M1
_Range:_ Referee’s discretion
_Duration:_ 2d6 turns

This spell magically holds a door or
gate in position for the spell’s dura-
tion (or until dispelled). Creatures
with magic resistance can shatter the
spell without much effort.

Insect Plague

_Level:_ C5
_Range:_ 480 ft.
_Duration:_ 1 day

This spell only works outdoors. A
storm of insects gathers, and goes
wherever the caster directs. The cloud


is approximately 400 square feet (20
× 20 feet, with roughly corresponding
height). Any creature with fewer than
2 HD exposed to the cloud of insects
will flee in terror (no saving throw).

Invisibility


Level: M2
Range: 240 ft.
Duration: Until dispelled or an attack
is made


The object of this spell, whether a
person or a thing, becomes invisible
to both normal vision and to darkvi-
sion. If the Referee is using the invis-
ibility rules unchanged, the result is
that an invisible creature cannot be
attacked unless its approximate lo-
cation is known, and all attacks are
made at -4 to-hit.

Invisibility, 10 ft. radius


Level: M3
Range: 240 ft.
Duration: Until dispelled or an attack
is made


Identical to the Invisibility spell,
which makes the target creature or
object invisible to normal vision and
to dark vision, except that it also
throws a sphere of invisibility (with a
10 foot radius) around the recipient,
which moves along with the target.


Invisible Stalker

_Level:_ M6
_Range:_ Near Caster
_Duration:_ Until mission is completed

This spell summons an Invisible
Stalker with 8 HD. The stalker will
perform one task as commanded by
the caster, regardless of how long the
task may take or how far the stalker
may have to travel. The stalker can-
not be banished by means of Dispel
Magic; it must be killed in order to
deter it from its mission.

Knock

_Level:_ M2
_Range:_ 60 ft.
_Duration:_ Instantaneous

This spell unlocks and unbars all
doors, gates, and portals within its
range, including those held or locked
by normal magic.

Levitate

_Level:_ M2
_Range:_ 20 ft. per level
_Duration:_ 10 minutes per level

This spell allows the Magic-user to
levitate himself, moving vertically up
or down, but the spell itself provides
no assistance with lateral movement.
A wall, cliff side, or ceiling could be
used to move along hand-over-hand.

Levitation allows up or downward
movement at a rate of up to 6 feet
per minute (60 feet per turn), and the
caster cannot levitate more than 20
feet per level from the ground level
where the spell was cast (such range


being applied both to movement into
the air and to downward movement
into a pit or chasm).

Light (Dark)


Level: C1, M1
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: 2 hours (C), 1 hour + 10
minutes per level (M)


 As a Light spell, the caster tar-
gets a person or object which then
produces a light about as bright as a
torch with a radius of 20 feet.


 As a Dark spell, the caster instead
causes night-time darkness to fall
upon the area with a radius of 20
feet.

Light (Dark), Continual


Level: C3, M2
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: Permanent until dispelled


 As a Light, Continual spell, the
caster targets a person or object
which then produces a light about
as bright as a torch with a radius of
20 feet.


 As a Dark, Continual spell, the
caster instead causes night-time
darkness to fall upon the area with a
radius of 20 feet.


Lightning Bolt

_Level:_ M3
_Range:_ 60 ft.
_Duration:_ Instantaneous

A nearly ten foot wide bolt of light-
ning extends 60 feet from the finger-
tip of the caster. Anyone in its path
suffers 1d6 points of damage per
level of the caster, though a success-
ful saving throw halves damage. The
bolt always extends 60 feet, even if
this means that it ricochets backward
from something that blocks its path.

Locate Object

_Level:_ C3, M2
_Range:_ 90 ft. (C), 60 ft. + 10 ft. per
level (M)
_Duration:_ 1 minutes per level

This spell gives the caster the correct
direction (as the crow flies) toward
an object the caster specifies with
a description. The object cannot be
something the caster has never seen,
although the spell can detect an ob-
ject in a general class of items known
to the caster: stairs, gold, etc.

Magic Jar


Level: M5
Range: See below
Duration: See below


This spell relocates the caster’s life es-
sence, intelligence, and soul into an
object (of virtually any kind). The “jar”
must be within 30 feet of the caster’s
body for the transition to succeed.


Once within the magic jar, the caster
can possess the bodies of other crea-
tures and people, provided that they
are within 120 feet of the jar and fail
a saving throw. The caster can return
his soul to the magic jar at any time,
and if a body he controls is slain, his
life essence returns immediately to
the jar. If the caster’s body is destroyed
while his soul is in the magic jar, the
soul no longer has a home other than
within the magic jar (although the
disembodied wizard can still possess
other bodies as before). If the jar itself
is destroyed while the Magic-user’s
soul is within, the soul is lost. The
Magic-user can return from the jar to
his own body whenever desired, thus
ending the spell.

Massmorph


Level: M4
Range: 240 ft.
Duration: Until negated or dispelled


One hundred or fewer human-sized
creatures are changed to appear like
innocent trees. The illusion is so per-
fect that creatures moving through
the “forest” will not detect the decep-
tion.


Move Earth

_Level:_ M6
_Range:_ 240 ft.
_Duration:_ Permanent

This spell can only be used above
ground. It allows the caster to move

_Range:_ 240 ft.

The caster must announce which of
the two options are being cast:


 The spell lowers the depth and
water level of lakes, rivers, wells, and
other bodies of water to 1/2 their
normal levels. Used this way, the
spell lasts for 10 turns.


 Alternately, this spell creates a
gap through water, but only to a
depth of 10 feet. Used this way, the
spell lasts for 6 turns.

Neutralize Poison

Phantasmal Force


Level: M2
Range: 240 ft.
Duration: Until negated or dispelled


This spell creates a realistic illusion
in the sight of all who view it. The il-
lusion disappears when it is touched,

is real he can take damage from it.

Plant Growth


Level: M4
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: Permanent until dispelled


Up to 300 square feet of ground can
be affected by this spell; undergrowth
in the area suddenly grows into an
impassable forest of thorns and vines.
The caster can decide the shape of the
area to be enchanted. An alternate
version (Referee’s decision) would al-
low the spell to affect an area of 300 ×
300 feet, for a total of 90,000 square
feet.


Polymorph

_Level:_ M4
_Range:_ See below
_Duration:_ See below

The caster must announce which of
the two options are being cast:


 The caster assumes the form of
any object or creature, gaining the
new form’s attributes (the use of
wings, for example), but not its hit
points or combat abilities. The Ref-
eree might allow the benefit of the
new form’s armor class, if it is due
to heavily armored skin. A great
deal of the spell’s effect is left to the
Referee to decide. This form of the
spell lasts for roughly one hour plus
one additional hour for each level of
the caster.


 Alternately, this spell allows the
caster to turn another being into a
different type of creature (such as a
dragon, a garden slug, and of course,
a frog or newt). The polymorphed
creature gains all the abilities of the
new form, but retains its own mind
and hit points. Used in this way, the
range on this spell is 60 feet. This
form of the spell lasts until dis-
pelled.

Project Image

_Level:_ M6
_Range:_ 240 ft.
_Duration:_ 1 hour

appear to originate from the image.

Range: Caster only
Duration: 2 hours (C), 1 hour (M)


 As a Protection from Chaos spell,

fer a -1 penalty “to-hit” against the
caster, and the caster gains +1 on all
saving throws against such attacks.


 As a Protection from Law spell,
it does the same thing except that

alty.


Protection from Chaos (Law), 10 ft.

_Duration:_ Until completed

If the victim fails his saving throw,
the caster may set a task for him. If a
Magic-user casts this spell the victim
will die if he ignores the Quest alto-
gether. If a Cleric casts this spell the
victim’s failure to obey will result in a
curse to be determined by the Referee.

Raise Dead


Level: C5
Range: Line of sight
Duration: See below


Raise Dead allows the Cleric to raise
a corpse from the dead, provided it
has not been dead too long. The nor-
mal time limit is 4 days, but for every
caster level higher than 8th, the time
limit extends another 4 days. Charac-
ters with low constitution might not
survive the ordeal; and even for those
with a strong constitution, a period
of two weeks is required before they
can function normally. This spell only
functions on races that can be used

Teleport

_Level:_ M5
_Range:_ Touch
_Duration:_ Instantaneous

This spell transports the caster or an-
other person to a destination that the
caster knows (at least knowing what it
looks like from a painting or a map).
Success depends on how well the
caster knows the targeted location:


 If the caster has only indirect ex-
perience of the destination (known
only through a picture or map)
there is a 25% chance of success—
with failure resulting in death.


 If the caster has seen but not
studied the destination there is a
20% chance of failure. Half of fail-


ures will place the traveler 1d10 ×
10 feet below the intended location,
possibly resulting in death from ar-
rival within a solid substance. The
other half of failures will place the
traveler 1d10 × 10 feet above the
targeted location, possibly resulting
in a deadly fall.


 If the caster is familiar with the
location or has studied it carefully
there is a 5% chance of failure, with
1 in 6 failures arriving below and 5
in 6 arriving above the targeted lo-
cation. In either case, the arrival is
1d4 × 10 feet low or high.

other form of earth) into mud, or mud
to rock. An area of roughly 300 × 300
feet becomes a deep mire, reducing
movement to 10% of normal.

Transform Stone-Flesh


Level: M6
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: Permanent until reversed


This spell transforms flesh into stone
or stone into flesh, as desired by the
caster. A saving throw is permitted to
avoid being turned into stone, but if
the spell succeeds the victim is trans-
formed into a statue.


Wall of Fire or Ice

_Level:_ M4
_Range:_ 60 ft.
_Duration:_ Concentration

The caster must announce which of
the two options are being cast:


 As a Wall of Fire spell, the caster
conjures a wall of fire that flares into
being and burns for as long as the
caster concentrates upon it. Crea-
tures with 3 or fewer hit dice can-
not pass through it, and no creature
can see through it to the other side.
Passing through the fire inflicts 1d6
hit points of damage (no saving
throw) and undead creatures sustain
twice the normal damage. The caster
may choose to create a straight wall
60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a
circular wall with a 15 foot radius,
also 20 feet high.


 As a Wall of Ice spell, the caster
conjures up a 6 foot thick wall of
ice. The caster may choose to create
a straight wall 60 feet long and 20
feet high, or a circular wall with a 15
foot radius, also 20 feet high. Crea-
tures with 3 or fewer hit dice cannot
affect the wall, but creatures of 4+
hit dice are able to smash through
it, taking 1d6 points of damage in
the process. Creatures with fire-
based metabolisms take 2d6 instead
of the normal 1d6. Fire spells and
magical effects are negated in the
vicinity of the wall.

Wall of Stone or Iron


Level: M5
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: Permanent (stone) or 2
hours (iron)


The caster must announce which of
the two options are being cast:


 As a Wall of Stone spell, the
caster conjures a wall of stone 2 feet
thick, with a surface area of 1,000
square feet.


 As a Wall of Iron spell, the caster
conjures an iron wall from thin air.
The wall is 3 feet thick, with a sur-
face area of 500 square feet.

Water Breathing


Level: M3
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 2 hours


This spell grants the ability to breathe
underwater until the spell’s duration
expires.

Web


Level: M2
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 8 hours


Fibrous, sticky webs fill an area up
to 10 × 10 × 20 feet. It is extremely
difficult to get through the mass of
strands—it takes one turn if a torch
and sword (or a flaming sword) are
used, and creatures larger than a horse
can break through in 2 turns. Hu-
mans take longer to break through—
perhaps 3 to 4 turns or longer at the
Referee’s discretion.


Wizard Eye

_Level:_ M4
_Range:_ 240 ft.
_Duration:_ 1 hour

The caster conjures up an invisible,
magical “eye,” that can move a maxi-
mum of 240 feet from its creator. It
floats along as directed by the caster,
at a rate of 120 feet per turn.

Wizard Lock


Level: M2
Range: Close
Duration: Permanent until dispelled


As with a Hold Portal spell, but it is
permanent until dispelled. Creatures
with magic resistance can shatter the
spell without effort. Any Magic-user
three levels or higher than the caster
can open the portal, and a Knock spell
will open it as well (although the spell
is not permanently destroyed in these
cases).


Running a game of White Box is a lot easier than running most other role-
playing games, simply because there are not as many rules and your own discre-
tion overrides them anyway. Most situations are handled by making common
sense decisions concerning what happens next.

For example: the players are in combat with a group of orcs and the fighter
wants to trip one of them. It’s up to the Referee to decide what the fighter
needs to do or roll to be successful. If a Player decides that his character is go-
ing to jump through a wall of fire, with several bottles of flammable oil in his
backpack, it’s up to the Referee to determine whether or not they explode.

This means making up a lot of stuff on the spot. If you’re not a good storyteller
or if you’re not up to doing a lot of creative thinking on the fly, it might be bet-
ter that you try a different game—one that provides more rules and guidance
for every situation that might arise. But if you’re a good storyteller, creative

# Chapter^7

## Runn

ing^ the (^) Game


and fair, White Box’s small, Spartan rule-set frees up your creativity to create
a fantasy role-playing experience completely different from the type of game
that depends on a multitude of rules.

White Box also frees up your creativity in terms of customizing the game.
Unlike a more complex game, you can add house rules wherever you want to
without accidentally messing up something else buried in the rules. If you want
to use critical hits and fumbles, add ‘em in. You won’t break anything—there’s
not that much to break!

###### Designing an Adventure

The “adventure” is just the setting for the game—usually a map and then notes
about certain locations on that map. As the Players tell you where their charac-
ters go and what they do, you’re referring to the map and your notes to describe
what happens as a result. Don’t try to plan for all contingencies—it’s guaran-
teed that the players will do something unexpected during the adventure and
you’ll just have to roll with it, thinking on your feet and making up new things
as you go. Just as you challenge the Players with adventure, they challenge you
to keep up with their collective creativity.


###### Creating a Campaign

A campaign is the world beyond the adventure—the cities, forests, coastlines,
and kingdoms of the fantasy world. The players will almost certainly want their
characters to explore the wilderness, visit cities, and do all sorts of things in
the fantasy world. At the beginning of the game, you might want to sketch out
a map of a single village (as the starting point) and some of the surrounding
area. (The location of the first adventure—a dark forest, perhaps) As the play-
ers move their characters around from adventure to adventure, you can expand
the little map into an entire fantasy world with the continents, kingdoms, and
great empires at your disposal.

If you want to take a shortcut, you can set your entire campaign in a fictional
world created by the author of one of your favorite fantasy stories. Most of
these have maps and the author has already created the details and feel of
the world for you. For example: the worlds of Conan’s Hyboria (Robert E.
Howard), of Elric and the Eternal Champions (Michael Moorcock), and of
the Dying Earth ( Jack Vance) are popular fictional settings ready for gaming.
Indeed, publishers have already created pre-packaged campaigns for all three
of these examples.

###### Experience Points

Experience Points are awarded to Players for
gaining treasure and killing monsters, as
described under “Gaining Experience” in
Chapter 5. It may seem counter-intuitive
that treasure somehow makes characters
more experienced, but that’s not what
awarding experience for gold pieces is
all about. Gold pieces are an after-
the-fact measurement of how
ingenious the character
(Player) was in getting


them. The gold pieces are not the source of the experience—they are the mea-
surable product of it.

That being said, there are many alternative ways for Referees to award XP. For
example, active participation in the campaign might warrant experience for
each hour of real-time play, as could solving puzzles and aiding allies. A par-
ticularly clever solution or epic victory might warrant double the normal XP
amount awarded, while an abysmal failure might merit half.

Some Referees make all earned Experience Points a part of a community total
to be divided evenly, since not all the characters have the same opportunities in
a given adventure. Others prefer a more competitive game, whereby each player
earns XP according to individual accomplishments.

If you find that whatever system you’re using leads the players toward bad de-
cisions—seeking out unnecessary combat or looking for traps to spring—you
might consider adjusting your system. This is true for the “official” system of
awarding experience as well. Remember, the Referee is the ultimate judge of
what works best for a game and any rule can be changed to fit the group.

###### Scale of Advancement

Referees all have their own style of campaign, and it would be silly for one
author to impose needless restrictions on anyone playing the game. However,
it is worth noting that this rule set was designed with the notion that 4th level
characters are “heroic” and thus the tables were capped at level 10. A Referee
who wishes to extend the tables to higher levels is encouraged to do so if it fits
the style of the campaign.


###### Underworld and Wilderness Adventures

Many Referees will create a map of the Underworld or Wilderness in advance
of play. The player characters will then explore the map but are unaware of its
contents.

In the Underworld a map is filled with monsters, traps, treasure, and any mys-
terious creatures or locations the Referee can dream into existence.

The Wilderness map is created using hexagon paper, with each hex represent-
ing 6 miles, and having a primary terrain and possibly an interesting feature.
A feature could be a Wizards tower, a Fighter’s stronghold, and an Evil High
Priest’s dark temple or maybe it could be a small elf like creature, sitting on a
tree stump, playing a magical flute. Let your imagination run wild when creat-
ing features.

##### Wandering Monsters

In the Underworld, check every hour (six turns), for wandering monsters and
in the Wilderness check every hex. Normally there is a 1 in 6 chance of en-
countering something in the Underworld. Check the Getting Lost and En-
counters table for chances of encounters in the Wilderness.


The specific encounter is rolled on
a table. Initial encounter distance
is dependent on the circumstance.

##### Reaction Check

The reaction of monsters to the
player character should be deter-
mined by the Referee based on
the monster’s intelligence or wis-
dom and the situation in which
the encounter occurs. Unintelli-
gent monsters will simply attack.
If there is any uncertainty about
the monsters reaction, a roll can be
made on the following table.


Table 33: Reaction Check
Roll 2d6 Reaction
2 or less Hostile
3-5 Negative
6-8 Uncertain
9-11 Positive
12 Enthusiastic

##### Getting Lost and Encounters

In the Wilderness, if the characters are following a road or trail, there isn’t a
chance of getting lost. If however, they are exploring unknown lands, there is
a chance of losing their way depending on the hex terrain.


Whether on well-marked roads or
out in the unknown, there is always
a chance for an encounter.


Roll d6 twice per hex to check for
becoming lost and/or an encounter

There’s not a lot of detail given about the monsters, because the more detail
given, the more your own mental image of the fantasy world is going to be
locked into a single track. We’re not going to say that giant ants are red, noc-
turnal, three feet long, and fond of eating Elves. Because, in your mind, they
might be blue, diurnal, five feet long, and eat only plants unless attacked. De-
tails about monsters toss roadblocks in front of the imagination. Yes, details
can also inspire imagination, but we’re making the assumption that if you’re
interested in fantasy gaming in the first place, you’ve got a good imagination
as-is and don’t require details about the size of a giant ant.

One important characteristic of all monsters, though, is that they can see in
the dark.

The following is a quick reference guide for how to read monster descriptions:

# Chapter^8

## Monsters


##### Armor Class

“Armor Class” is explained earlier in the rules for combat. If you’re using the
Descending AC system (where lower AC is better), disregard the numbers in
brackets. If you’re using the Ascending AC system (where a high AC is better),
use the numbers in brackets.

##### Attacks

“Attacks” lists the number of attacks a monster has and the damage they inflict.
Most monsters have one attack and inflict 1d6 damage—there are, however,
some exceptions.

##### Experience Points

“Experience Points” are presented after a monster’s Hit Dice Equivalent
(HDE) rating, and list the number of XP the adventuring party gains as a
result of killing the creature. In some cases, however, the Referee may choose
to award experience points for defeating a creature without killing it (circum-
venting it by creative means, capturing it to bring home, etc.). Some monsters
have multiple Experience Points listed—this is because certain monsters have
a range of hit dice. Order is always from lowest HD to highest HD.

##### Hit Dice

“Hit Dice” is the number of dice (d6) rolled to determine an individual crea-
ture’s Hit Points (HP). If there is a plus or minus after the number, add or
subtract that number once from the total rolled.

##### Hit Dice Equivalent

“Hit Dice Equivalent” is used to separate monsters into “difficulty levels” so
that when creating an adventure the Referee has some guidelines concerning
what characters can and cannot handle. Some monsters have multiple HDE’s
listed—this is because certain monsters have a range of hit dice. Order is al-
ways from lowest HD to highest HD.

##### Magic Resistance

“Magic Resistance” isn’t one of the entries, but some creatures may have “magic
resistance.” The given percentage chance is the likelihood that any magic used
against the creature (other than bonuses from weapons) will fail to take effect.
To determine whether or not magic used will have an impact, roll a d100. The
magic fails if the result is less than the given percentage.

##### Move

“Move” is the monster’s movement rate and is handled like it is for PCs.

##### Saving Throw

“Saving Throw” isn’t one of the entries, but all creatures have a saving throw.
It is the number on the d20 the monster needs to equal or exceed in order to


avoid a threat or lessen its effect. It is found by subtracting the monster’s HD
from 19. For example, a monster with 4 HD has a saving throw of 15. Alter-
natively, a monster can simply be treated as a Fighter or whatever character
class makes sense for that monster, with the monster’s hit dice being used for
its level.

##### Special

“Special” is just a “flag” of sorts for the Referee that serves as a reminder that a
monster has a special ability.

##### Note

If you are using the quick formula for calculating attacks using the ascending
armor class system, the monster’s normal “to-hit” bonus is equal to its hit dice
(capped at +15). For example, a monster with 3 HD attacks with a +3 “to-hit”
bonus.


Banshee

_Armor Class_ : 0 [19]
_Hit Dice_ : 7
_Attacks_ : Claw
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 11/1,700

Banshees are horrid fey (or undead)
creatures that live in swamps and
other desolate places. They can only
be harmed by magical or silver weap-
ons. Banshees have a 49% resistance
to magic, and they are immune to
enchantments. Their shriek (once
per day) necessitates a saving throw
versus death or the hearer will die in
2d6 rounds. They can travel over wa-
ter and other terrain as if it were land,
but crossing running water causes it
to lose its magic resistance for 3d6
hours. They look like gaunt humans
with long, stringy hair and glowing
yellow eyes. They often wear hooded
cloaks. At the Referee’s discretion,
such creatures might be undead rath-
er than faerie-folk, and are considered
to have 9 HD for turning purposes.

Basilisk


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 6
Attacks : Bite
Special : Petrifying gaze
Move : 6
HDE/XP : 8/800


Basilisks are great lizards whose gaze
turns to stone anyone meeting its eye
(fighting without looking incurs a -4
penalty “to-hit”). If the basilisk’s own
gaze is reflected back at it, it has a
10% chance to force the basilisk into
a saving throw against being turned
to stone itself.

Beetle, Giant Fire


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 1+3
Attacks : Bite
Special : None
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 1/15


A giant fire beetle’s oily light-glands
glow red, and continue to give off
light for 1d6 days after they are re-
moved (shedding light in a 10 foot
radius).

with an acidic surface. They are sub-
terranean predators and scavengers.
Any weapon or armor contacting a
black pudding will be eaten away by
the acid as follows: weapon (1 hit by
weapon on the pudding), chain mail
or lesser armor (1 hit by pudding),
plate mail (2 hits by pudding). If a
weapon or armor is magical, it can
take an additional hit per +1 before
being dissolved. They are immune
to cold and divide when attacked by
lightning.

Blink Dog

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 6
_Attacks_ : Bite
_Special_ : Teleport
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 4/120

Blink dogs are pack hunters, intel-
ligent and usually friendly to those
who are not of evil intent. They can
teleport short distances (without er-
ror) and attack in the same turn—in
most cases (75%) a blink dog will be
able to teleport behind an opponent
and attack from the rear (with bo-
nuses).

Bugbear


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 3+1
Attacks : Weapon or bite
Special : Surprise opponents
Move : 9
HDE/XP : 3/60


These large, hairy, goblin-like hu-
manoids are stealthier than their size
would suggest, almost always getting
the chance to surprise even the most
alert opponents with a roll of 1–3 on
a d6 (50% of the time).

Centaur


Armor Class : 5 [14], 4 [16] w/ shield
Hit Dice : 4
Attacks : Weapon or kick
Special : None
Move : 18
HDE/XP : 5/240


Half man, half horse, centaurs are
fierce warriors and well-known crea-
tures of mythology. The Referee may
choose any “version” of the centaur
from folklore for his campaign: some
are chaotic, some aloof, and some are
soothsayers.


Centipede, Giant (small)

_Armor Class_ : 9 [10]
_Hit Dice_ : 1d2 HP
_Attacks_ : Bite
_Special_ : Poison (see below)
_Move_ : 13
_HDE/XP_ : 2/30

Giant lethal centipedes of the small
size inflict a lethal amount of poison
with each bite, but inflict no damage
if the saving throw is successful (+4
modifier to opponent’s saving throw).

Centipede, Giant (medium)

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 2
_Attacks_ : Bite
_Special_ : Poison (see below)
_Move_ : 15
_HDE/XP_ : 4/120

This man-sized giant centipede is a
deadly predator with armored seg-
ments, a vicious bite, and a lethal
(though relatively weak) poison (+6
modifier to opponent’s saving throw).

Centipede, Giant (large)


Armor Class : 0 [19]
Hit Dice : 4
Attacks : Bite
Special : Poison (see below)
Move : 18
HDE/XP : 6/400


A twenty-foot long horror of chitin,
multiple legs, and clashing pincers
dripping with venom (+6 modifier to
opponent’s saving throw).

Chimera


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 9
Attacks : Bite (equals # of heads)
Special : Breathes fire, flies
Move : 12/18 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 11/1,700


The chimera is a winged, three headed
beast; one is the head of a goat, one
the head of a lion, and one the head
of a dragon. The dragon head can
breathe fire (3 times per day) with a
range of 50 feet, causing 3d8 dam-
age to anyone caught within the fiery
blast (saving throw for half damage).


Cockatrice

_Armor Class_ : 6 [13]
_Hit Dice_ : 5
_Attacks_ : Bite
_Special_ : Bite turns bitten into stone
_Move_ : 6/18 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 7/600

Resembles a bat-winged rooster with
a long, serpentine tail. Its bite turns
enemies to stone unless a successful
saving throw is made.

Death Knight

_Armor Class_ : 0 [20]
_Hit Dice_ : 10
_Attacks_ : Two-Handed Sword (1d6+3)
_Special_ : See Below
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 12/2000

These terrible undead knights are clad
in black armor and wield terrible two-
handed swords with great strength.
In addition to increased damage,
each time a death knight successfully
strikes a foe with their sword the tar-
get loses one level. Death Knights are


also immune to all spells of 5th level
or lower. They can cast a Fireball once
per day that inflicts 7d6 points of
damage. They are immune to damage
from mundane weapons and cannot
be banished by a cleric.

## Demons


Demons are creatures of the lower
planes of existence, but they are occa-
sionally encountered in places where
they have been enslaved to serve as
guardians by powerful Magic-users or
Chaotic Clerics. The more intelligent
varieties might also be interrupted
while carrying out plots of their own.
There is no meaningful game distinc-
tion between demons and devils.

Demon, Balor


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 9
Attacks : Sword or whip (2d6)
Special : See below
Move : 6/15 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 10/1,400


These powerful demons somewhat
resemble vast minotaurs with great,
spreading bat-wings; they burn with
the fires of hell and are wreathed in
flame. The spells of casters below 6th
level do not affect them, and against
higher-level spell casters they are yet
75% immune to all spells. In combat,
a Balor uses whip and sword; the whip
can be used to reach great distances—
on a successful hit the victim is pulled
close to the Balor and burned by the
fires of the demon’s body (3d6 dam-
age). Balor are sometimes referred to
in ancient texts as Baalroch, which
may be the name of a single demon


rather than a term for all of them. A
Balor could be forced or tricked into
the service of a powerful wizard, but
the risk would be immense.

Demon, Imp

_Armor Class_ : 3 [16]
_Hit Dice_ : 3
_Attacks_ : Poison Tail Sting (1d6-1)
_Special_ : See Below
_Move_ : 6 (12 when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 3/60

These tiny devilish creatures are red
or black in skin color with cat-like
eyes, long pointed tails and bat-wings.
They are the lowliest of demons and
often serve as slaves to greater de-
mons or servants of powerful evil
clerics and magic-users. Imps are im-
mune to non-magical weapons and
fire and can cast Detect Magic at will
and Invisibility once per day – both
as a magic-user. Their tail has a mod-
erately powerful poison which can
kill if a saving throw is not successful,
though the victim receives a +4 bonus
to their roll.

Demon, Succubus


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 6
Attacks : Bite (1d6-1)
Special : Charm Person
Move : 12 (15 when flying)
HDE/XP : 6/400


A succubus is a demon of lust who
appears as a scantily-clad voluptuous
human woman with a great pair of
bat-wings sprouting from her shoul-
der blades. Though not effective in
direct combat, she can charm with a
word or a kiss and often surrounds
herself with a horde of thralls bent to
her will. This ability allows the Suc-
cubus to cast Charm Person at will.
If slain, their physical body returns to
the infernal planes to which they are
native.


Demon, Lemure

_Armor Class_ : 7 [12]
_Hit Dice_ : 3
_Attacks_ : Claw
_Special_ : Regenerate (1 HP/round)
_Move_ : 3
_HDE/XP_ : 4/120

Lemures are vaguely humanoid—
their flesh is mud-like, shifting and
soft upon their horrible bodies. Like
manes and wretches, lemures are low-
er forms of demons, the fleshly mani-
festations of damned souls. These
demons can only be permanently de-
stroyed by sprinkling their disgusting
bodies with holy water.

Djinni

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 7+1
_Attacks_ : Fist or weapon (2d6)
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 9/24 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 9/1,100

Djinn are one of the genies of folk-
lore, creatures of the air (and possibly
of the elemental planes). They can


carry 700 pounds of weight, and have
a number of magical powers. A djin-
ni can create food and water of high
quality, as well as wooden and cloth
objects. They can also create objects of
metal (including coins), but all such
magically created metals disappear
in time. Djinn can call up illusions,
and although these are quite excellent
they disappear when touched. Djinni
can turn themselves into gaseous form
(cannot attack or be attacked, can en-
ter any area that is not airtight), and
can become invisible at will. Finally, a
djinni can turn itself into a whirlwind
much like an air elemental, sweeping
away any creature with one or fewer
hit dice (the diameter of the whirl-
wind is 10 feet). More powerful types
of djinn might be capable of granting
limited wishes or even true wishes.

Doppelganger


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 4
Attacks : Claw
Special : See below
Move : 9
HDE/XP : 5/240


A doppelganger can change its form
to resemble the physical appearance
(including clothing and gear) of any
person. These creatures are immune to
sleep and charm, and are considered
magic resistant for purposes such as
breaking through wizard locks and
similar spells. They have a very good
saving throw (+5) against magic of all
kinds.


## Dragons

All dragons have a breath weapon of some kind, which can be used up to three
times in a day. The Referee chooses when a dragon will use the breath weapon
or may roll for it (50% chance) in any given round.

Referees should not roll for a dragon’s hit points, like one would for other mon-
sters. Instead, determine the age category of the dragon—this will give both
the dragon’s hit points per hit dice and how many points of breath weapon
damage per hit dice the dragon inflicts.

For example, an “Adult” dragon has both 4 hit points and 4 points of breath
weapon damage per hit dice. So an “Adult” black dragon with 6 HD would
have 24 HP and deal 24 points of acid damage when using its breath weapon.



Table 41: Dragon Age Category


Roll Age Hit Points/Hit Dice Damage/Hit Dice
1 Very Young 1 1
2 Young 2 2
3 Immature 3 3
4 Adult 4 4
5 Old 5 5
6 Very Old (100 years) 6 6
7 Aged (100–400) 7 7
8 Ancient (400+) 8 8


Table 42: Dragon Breath Weapons
Shape* Type
Cloud Gaseous
Cone Fiery/Frosty
Line Spitting


* The dimensions of a dragon’s breath differ according to the dragon’s type.

Note that dragons, while dangerous opponents, are not by any means invin-
cible. In a medieval-type fantasy world, dragons are a common problem rather
than a godlike creature of legend—so the statistics for dragons reflect a deadly
but not mythical foe. The Referee is, of course, free to create stats for a more
“mythical” conception of dragons. Since dice aren’t rolled for dragon hit points,
it is possible for a truly mythical dragon to have more “numbers” per die than
it’s actually possible to roll on a hit dice.

Dragon, Blue


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 8–10
Attacks : Bite (2d6)
Special : Spits lightning
Move : 12/24 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 10/1,400; 11/1,700;
12/2,000


Blue dragons spit a blast of electric
lightning, affecting everything in its
path, in a line 5 feet wide and 100

Dragon, Black

_Armor Class_ : 2 [17]
_Hit Dice_ : 6–8
_Attacks_ : Bite (1d6+2)
_Special_ : Spits acid
_Move_ : 12/24 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 8/800; 9/1,100; 10/1,400

Black dragons spit a deadly, corrosive
acid. The acid covers everything in a
line 5 feet wide and 60 feet long.


feet long. A successful saving throw
against the blast of lightning indi-
cates half damage.

Dragon, Gold

_Armor Class_ : 2 [17]
_Hit Dice_ : 10–12
_Attacks_ : Bite (2d6+2)
_Special_ : Breathes poisonous gas or fire
_Move_ : 12/24 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 12/2,000; 13/2,300;
14/2,600

Gold dragons are of lawful alignment,
can always speak, and cast spells as
if they were a Magic-user of equal
level to their age category (so that
“Very Old” gold dragons are 6th level
Magic-users). They can choose to ei-
ther breathe fire in a cone 90 feet long
and roughly 30 feet wide at the base
or breathe chlorine gas in a cloud 50
feet in diameter.

Dragon, Green


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 7–9
Attacks : Bite (2d6)
Special : Breathes poisonous gas
Move : 12/24 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 9/1,100; 10/1,400;
11/1,700


Green dragons breathe a cloud of poi-
sonous gas that is 50 feet in diameter.
A successful saving throw indicates
half damage.

Dragon, Red


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 9–11
Attacks : Bite (2d6+1)
Special : Breathes fire
Move : 12/24 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 11/1,700; 12/2,000;
13/2,300


Red dragons are the fire-breathing
wyrms of legend. They breathe fire in
a cone-shape 90 feet long and roughly
30 feet wide at the base.

Dragon, White


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 5–7
Attacks : Bite (1d6 +1)
Special : Breathes cold
Move : 12/24 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 7/600; 8/800; 9/1,100


White dragons are usually found in
cold regions, where they can utilize
their natural camouflage in the ice
and snow to ambush their prey. They
breathe intensely cold air and frost in
a cone shape 70 feet long and roughly
30 feet wide at the base.


Dryad

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 2
_Attacks_ : Dagger, wooden
_Special_ : Charm Person
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 3/60

Dryads are beautiful female tree spir-
its, and do not venture far from their
home trees. They can cast (as a na-
tive magical power) a strong charm
that operates as a Charm Person spell
with a -2 saving throw. Those who are
charmed seldom return, or might be
kept for a hundred years and a day
within the dryad’s tree.

Dwarf

_Armor Class_ : 4 [15]
_Hit Dice_ : 1+1
_Attacks_ : War Hammer
_Special_ : Stonework insight
_Move_ : 6
_HDE/XP_ : 1/15

Statistics above are for the common
Dwarf with no particular unusual
characteristics. A Dwarf-at-arms
would usually have a full 7 HP, re-
flecting skill and general toughness.
Stronger Dwarves (sergeants-at-
arms, for example) might have more
hit dice or unusual bonuses “to-hit”,
even magical abilities if Dwarves
are magical in your fantasy universe.
(Norse myths are a good example of
this.) Do not bother to treat more
powerful NPC Dwarves as Fight-
ers or character types; just assign the
right number of HD and abilities (if
any) and keep moving along with the
fantasy.

Efreeti


Armor Class : 3 [16]
Hit Dice : 10
Attacks : Fist or sword (2d6)
Special : Wall of Fire
Move : 9/24 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 12/2,000


Efreet are a type of genie, associated
with fire (unlike the djinn, who have
powers over the air). Efreet can carry
up to a thousand pounds of weight,
and under the right circumstances
they can be forced to serve as a slave
(until they figure out how to free
themselves). An efreeti can cast Wall
of Fire. They appear as giant humans
with cruel features, their skin flicker-
ing with flames.

## Elementals


Elementals are living manifestations
of the basic forms of matter; earth, air,
fire, and water. They are usually sum-
moned from their native planes of ex-
istence to do the bidding of a power-
ful wizard. These beings can also be
“chained” within objects or structures
to give the objects magical proper-
ties. Elementals are barely intelligent
at all, but they are as powerful as the
forces of nature that they actually are.


Elemental, Air

_Armor Class_ : 2 [17]
_Hit Dice_ : 8, 12, 16
_Attacks_ : Strike (2d6)
_Special_ : Whirlwind
_Move_ : 36 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 9/1,100; 13/2,300;
17/3,500

Air elementals can turn into a whirl-
wind of air with a diameter of 30 feet,
hurling any creature of 1 HD or less
for great distances (almost certainly
killing them). Elemental whirlwinds
are approximately 100 feet tall.

Elemental, Earth

_Armor Class_ : 2 [17]
_Hit Dice_ : 8, 12, 16
_Attacks_ : Fist (2d6)
_Special_ : Stone destruction
_Move_ : 6
_HDE/XP_ : 9/1,100; 13/2,300;
17/3,500

Earth elementals are hulking human-
like shapes of rock and earth. They
batter opponents with their great
fists, although damage is reduced by
1d6 if the opponent is not standing
upon earth or rock. Earth elementals
can tear apart stone structures, able to
rip down even a castle wall in a matter
of 1d4+4 minutes.

Elemental, Fire


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 8, 12, 16
Attacks : Strike (2d6)
Special : Ignite materials
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 9/1,100; 13/2,300;
17/3,500


Fire elementals are formless masses of
flame, perhaps with a vaguely human
shape. Their attacks cause flammable
materials to ignite if the material fails
a saving throw (as determined by the
Referee).

Elemental, Water


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 8, 12, 16
Attacks : Strike (2d6)
Special : Overturn ships
Move : 6/18 (when swimming)
HDE/XP : 9/1,100; 13/2,300;
17/3,500


Water elementals cannot move more
than 60 feet from a large body of water,
and their damage is reduced by 1d6 if
the opponent is not standing (or in)
a body of water. These powerful be-
ings can overturn small boats, and can
overturn a ship if given 1d4+4 min-
utes to work at it. On water, they can
attack ships, battering them to pieces
within one hour if not prevented or
distracted.


Elf

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 1+1
_Attacks_ : Longbow or sword
_Special_ : None
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 1/15

The example above is for a typical
Elf; trained warriors would likely
have the maximum 7 HP. Obviously,
Elves encountered in the course of a
party’s adventuring will have a vari-
ety of powers and different attributes.
The Referee will assign such powers
as he sees fit, in accordance with the
way he envisions Elves. They might
be the woodland dwellers of Tolkien’s
The Hobbit, or the high Elves of the
Lord of the Rings, or might be the
faerie-folk of Irish legend. In any case,
as with Dwarves, don’t bother trying
to fit your “advanced” elves into the
constraints of character classes—just
make up their attributes to fit what
you need. NPCs aren’t subject to the
rules that govern building a player


character; they are your tools for good
fantasy, not an exercise in formula ap-
plication.

Elf, Dark


Armor Class : 5 [16]
Hit Dice : 2
Attacks : See Below
Special : See Below
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 2/30


These cousins of surfaces elves have
dark skin and white hair. They raid
all surface-dwellers, but especially
elves who they hate the most. They
typically wield short swords (1d6
damage) and light crossbows whose
bolts are coated in a paralytic poison
(1d6 damage, save or be paralyzed for
one turn). They are extraordinarily
stealthy, surprising their foes on 1-4
on 1d6. They are also highly resistant
to magic, receiving a +5 bonus to all
saving throws made to resist it.

Fairie Dragon


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 2
Attacks : Bite (1d6-1)
Special : Sleep Breath, Invisibility
Move : 9 (12 while flying)
HDE/XP : 3/60


These small gossamer-winged drag-
ons are no larger than a house cat.
They are playful and friendly, not
typically seeking combat. Instead they
breathe a cloud of gas with a 20’ ra-
dius. All creatures caught in the cloud
must make a saving throw or be put to
sleep for 2d6 hours. If cornered, they
will use their ability to cast Invisibility


once per day to hide themselves. They
are fond of shiny objects and twin-
kling baubles.

Gargoyle

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 4
_Attacks_ : Claw
_Special_ : Flight
_Move_ : 9/15 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 6/400

Gargoyles are winged creatures re-
sembling the carved monstrosities
that bedeck the walls of cathedrals
and many subterranean dungeons.
They can be vicious predators.

Gelatinous Cube

_Armor Class_ : 8 [11]
_Hit Dice_ : 4
_Attacks_ : Strike
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 6
_HDE/XP_ : 5/240

Gelatinous cubes are semi-transparent
cubes that slosh through subterranean
passages, engulfing debris and car-
rion to digest. Their entire substance
is acidic: if the cube hits successfully,
the victim must make a saving throw
or become paralyzed (6 turns)—dur-
ing which time the cube will attempt
to devour its victim. Most gelatinous
cubes contain various metallic trea-
sures or gems that they have engulfed
but not yet digested. Gelatinous cubes
are immune to lightning and cold.

Ghoul


Armor Class : 6 [13]
Hit Dice : 2
Attacks : Claw
Special : See below
Move : 9
HDE/XP : 3/60


Ghouls are pack-hunting undead,
corpse eaters. They are immune, like
most undead, to charms and sleep
spells. The most dangerous feature
of these horrid, cunning creatures is
their paralyzing touch: any hit from
a ghoul requires a saving throw or
the victim becomes paralyzed for 3d6
turns.


## Giants

Giants are a staple of fantasy gaming,
huge and dangerous creatures that of-
ten have a taste for human flesh. Most
are not particularly intelligent.

Giant, Cloud

_Armor Class_ : 4 [15]
_Hit Dice_ : 12+2
_Attacks_ : Weapon (3d6)
_Special_ : Hurls boulders
_Move_ : 15
_HDE/XP_ : 13/2,300

Cloud giants are cunning beasts, of-
ten living in cloud-castles in the sky
(hence their name). They throw rocks
for 6d6 hit points of damage. Cloud
giants are famous for their ability to
smell out food, enemies, and English-
men.

Giant, Firbolg

_Armor Class_ : 3 [16]
_Hit Dice_ : 9+2
_Attacks_ : Weapon (2d6)
_Special_ : Hurl boulders, Detect Magic
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 10/1,400

Appearing as giant men (ten feet tall)
with flaming red beards, firbolg dwell
in rocky and volcanic regions where
they live in clans of miners and under-
ground fungus farmers. Unlike other
giants, they are not warlike by nature
and instead prefer to make prodigious
use of their ability to throw boulders
and fight from a distance, which in-
flict 2d6 points of damage. They are


as intelligent as humans and have the
natural ability to cast Detect Magic at
will.

Giant, Fire


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 11+3
Attacks : Weapon (2d6)
Special : Hurls boulders, fire immunity
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 12/2,000


Fire giants are usually found near vol-
canic mountains, in great castles of
basalt or even iron. They throw boul-
ders for 5d6 hit points and are im-
mune to fire.

Giant, Frost


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 10+1
Attacks : Weapon (2d6)
Special : Hurls boulders, cold immu-
nity
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 12/2,000


Frost giants dwell in cold regions,
where they build (or conquer) castles
in remote places of ice and snow. They
throw boulders or great chunks of ice
for 4d6 points of damage and are im-
mune to cold.


Giant, Hill

_Armor Class_ : 4 [15]
_Hit Dice_ : 8
_Attacks_ : Weapon (2d6)
_Special_ : Hurls boulders
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 9/1,100

Hill giants are the least of the giant
races; most are brutish cave-dwellers
who dress in pelts and uncured hides.
They throw rocks for 2d8 points of
damage.

Giant, Stone

_Armor Class_ : 4 [15]
_Hit Dice_ : 9
_Attacks_ : Club (2d6)
_Special_ : Hurls boulders
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 10/1,400

Stone giants dwell in caves, isolated
in the mountain fastness. They throw
rocks for 3d6 points of damage, and
can be quite crafty in setting up am-
bushes in their native mountains—
travelers who wander into the terri-
tory of stone giants seldom return.

Giant, Storm

_Armor Class_ : 1 [18]
_Hit Dice_ : 16
_Attacks_ : Weapon (3d6)
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 15
_HDE/XP_ : 16/3,200

Storm giants are the largest of gi-
ants, the most intelligent, the most
magical, and the most likely to talk
with humans rather than simply de-
vour them. Storm giants can live in


underwater sea-castles as well as on
the heights of mountains. They throw
boulders for 7d6 points of damage,
and have the power to cast Control
Weather.

Gnoll


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 2
Attacks : Bite
Special : None
Move : 9
HDE/XP : 2/30


Gnolls are tall humanoids with hy-
ena-like heads. They may be found
both above ground and in subterra-
nean caverns. They form into loosely
organized clans, often ranging far
from home to steal and kill with ra-
pacious ferocity.

Gnome


Armor Class : 7
Hit Dice : 1
Attacks : Short Bow or Short Sword
(1d6-1)
Special : Phantasmal Force
Move : 9
HDE/XP : 1/15


Gnome are industrious, peaceful be-
ings. They dwell mostly deep under-
ground. They rarely stand higher than
3’ and have long beards and pointed
noses. They are peaceful by nature,
seeking only to mine for gems and
other valuables, engage in the oc-
casional prank. Gnomes are natural
foes of goblins and kobolds, as well
as skilled illusionists. All gnomes can
cast Phantasmal Force once per day.


Goblin

_Armor Class_ : 6 [13]
_Hit Dice_ : 1-1
_Attacks_ : Weapon
_Special_ : -1 “to-hit” in sunlight
_Move_ : 9
_HDE/XP_ : < 1/10

Goblins are small creatures (4 feet tall
or so) that inhabit dark woods, un-
derground caverns, and (possibly) the
otherworldly realms of the fey. They
attack with a -1 “to-hit” in the full
sunlight.

## Golems

Golems are man-shaped creatures
built to serve their masters, usually
powerful wizards or high priests. They
are often used as guardians. Golems
cannot be hit with non-magical
weapons, and are immune to the sorts
of spells used to create them (iron
golems being immune to fire, for in-
stance).

Golem, Flesh


Armor Class : 9 [10]
Hit Dice : 12
Attacks : Fist (1d6+2)
Special : See below
Move : 8
HDE/XP : 12/2,000


A creation stitched together from hu-
man limbs and other parts, like Fran-
kenstein’s monster. Damage inflicted
by lightning heals the golem, and it is
slowed by fire and cold. No other type
of spell than lightning, fire, or cold af-
fects a flesh golem. Only +1 or bet-
ter magic weapons can harm a flesh
golem.


Golem, Glass

_Armor Class_ : 6 [13]
_Hit Dice_ : 9
_Attacks_ : fist or weapon (1d6)
_Special_ : See Below
_Move_ : 9
_HDE/XP_ : 9/1,100

Whether crafted from animated
stained glass, or massive piles of
jagged shards, these behemoths
are sometimes animated to protect
churches and other holy sites. They
are immune to non-magical weap-
ons and take only one point of dam-
age from attacks made with magical
weapons which are not blunt. They
take half damage from fire spells, but
reduce their movement by half for
one round after suffering it. They are
immune to all other forms of magic.

Golem, Iron

_Armor Class_ : 3 [16]
_Hit Dice_ : 13
_Attacks_ : Fist or weapon (2d6)
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 6
_HDE/XP_ : 17/3,500

Iron golems are huge moving statues
of iron. They can breathe a 10 foot
radius cloud of poison gas as well as
attacking with great power. Only +3
or better magic weapons can harm an
iron golem. These hulking statues are
slowed by lightning spells, but fire-
based spells actually restore hit points
to them. No other type of spell affects
them.

Golem, Stone


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 16
Attacks : Fist (2d6)
Special : See below
Move : 6
HDE/XP : 16/3,200


Stone golems are massive stone stat-
ues animated by very powerful magics
(much more than just animate object,
in other words). They are slowed by
fire spells, and damaged/healed by
rock to mud spells and the reverse.
Spells that affect rock (and fire spells)
are the only magic that affects them.
They can only be hit by weapons +2
or better.

Golem, Wood


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 10
Attacks : fist (1d6+2)
Special : See Below
Move : 6
HDE/XP : 10/1,400


These lumbering constructs are of-
ten mistaken for treants and typi-
cally protect hidden groves and glens
claimed by powerful spell casters.
They are nearly invisible when in a
forested area, surprising their enemies
on a 1-5 on 1d6. They are immune to
mundane weapons and all magic, ex-
cept fire and fire-based spells, which
inflict normal damage.


Gorgon

_Armor Class_ : 2 [17]
_Hit Dice_ : 8
_Attacks_ : Gore (1d6+1)
_Special_ : Stone breath
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 10/1,400

Gorgons are bull-like creatures with
dragon-like scales. Their breath turns
people to stone (60 foot range, saving
throw applies).

Grey Ooze

_Armor Class_ : 8 [11]
_Hit Dice_ : 3
_Attacks_ : Strike
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 1
_HDE/XP_ : 5/240

Grey ooze is almost identical to wet
rock, but is a slimy, formless substance
that devours prey and carrion with its
acidic secretions, lashing forward to
strike enemies. Grey ooze is immune
to spells, heat, and cold damage. Met-
al (but not stone or wood) must make
a saving throw vs. acid when exposed
to grey ooze (even if the contact is as
brief as the strike of a sword) or be
rotted through. When the grey ooze
hits a character in metal armor, the ar-
mor must make an item saving throw.
Only cutting and piercing damages a
grey ooze—it is impervious to blunt
or crushing attacks.

Green Slime

Green slime isn’t technically a mon-
ster, just an extremely dangerous haz-
ard in underground tombs and other
such places. Any metal or organic


substance it touches begins to turn to
green slime (saving throw). It can be
killed with fire or extreme cold, and
the transformation process can be
arrested by the use of the spell Cure
Disease.

Griffon


Armor Class : 3 [16]
Hit Dice : 7
Attacks : Bite
Special : Flight
Move : 12/30 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 8/800


Griffons have the body of a lion, with
the wings, head, and fore-talons of an
eagle. These creatures can be tamed
and ridden as mounts. They usually
nest in high mountain aeries, where
they lay their eggs and hunt their prey.
Because the fledglings can be tamed,
young griffons and griffon eggs com-
mand a very high price in the market-
places of the great cities, or to barons
and wizards.

Harpy


Armor Class : 7 [12]
Hit Dice : 3
Attacks : Talons
Special : Flight, siren song
Move : 6/18 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 4/120


Harpies have the upper body of a
human female and the lower body
and wings of a vulture. Their song is
a charm that draws its victims to the
harpy (saving throw applies), and the
harpy’s touch casts the equivalent of
a Charm Person spell (again, saving
throw applies).


Hell Hound

_Armor Class_ : 4 [15]
_Hit Dice_ : 4–7
_Attacks_ : Bite
_Special_ : Breathes fire
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 5/240; 6/400; 7/600; 8/800

Hell hounds are fire-breathing dogs
of the underworlds or lower planes.
In addition to biting, they can breathe
fire each round, inflicting 2 HP dam-
age per hit die (10 foot range, saving
throw for half damage).

Hippogriff

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 3+1
_Attacks_ : Claws
_Special_ : Flight
_Move_ : 12/36 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 3/60

The hippogriff is similar to a griffon,
having the head, foreclaws, and wings
of an eagle, but instead of the body
of a lion, it has the body of a horse.
The poem Orlando Furioso (written
in 1516) suggests that the hippog-
riff is the offspring of a griffon and a
horse—but they are apparently an in-
dependent breed, for folkloric tradi-
tion holds that griffons frequently at-
tack hippogriffs. Hippogriffs are not
as hard to train as griffons—again,
from Orlando Furioso:

“Drawn by enchantment from his dis-
tant lair, The wizard thought but how
to tame the foal; And, in a month, in-
structed him to bear Saddle and bit,
and gallop to the goal; And execute
on earth or in mid air, All shifts of
manege, course and caracole...”

Hobgoblin


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 1+1
Attacks : Weapon
Special : None
Move : 9
HDE/XP : 1/15


Hobgoblins are simply large gob-
lins, possibly a separate breed living
apart from their smaller cousins. As
a matter of the campaign’s flavoring,
the Referee might choose to make
hobgoblins the “fey” goblins of Irish
legend, while regular goblins are the
more Tolkien-style underground-
dwellers.

Horse


Horses are AC 7 [12], with riding
horses having 2 HD and a Move of
24 and warhorses having 3 HD and
a Move of 18. Draft horses have a
Move of 12.


## Humans

Humans are such a versatile race that
any number of “monsters” and NPCs
can be made from them. Berserker
warriors, tribesmen, cavemen, prin-
cesses, evil high priests, captains of
the guard, foot-soldiers, and tavern-
keepers are all different human “mon-
sters.”

Don’t try to build your non-player
characters according to the rules
for player characters. Here are some
samples, otherwise just make up their
stats and abilities as you see fit.

Human, Bandit

_Armor Class_ : 7 [12]
_Hit Dice_ : 1
_Attacks_ : Weapon
_Special_ : None
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 1/15

Bandits are roving groups of thieves,
sometimes organized into small
armies led by more powerful bandit
chiefs and captains with higher hit
dice.

Human, Berserker


Armor Class : 7 [12]
Hit Dice : 1+2
Attacks : Weapon
Special : Berserking
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 2/30


Berserkers are normal humans, but
they fight with astounding ferocity. A
bonus of +2 is added to their attack
rolls. They do not wear armor heavier
than leather armor.

Human, Sergeant-at-Arms


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 3
Attacks : Weapon
Special : None
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 3/60


Human sergeants are normally found
in command of 1d6+5 human sol-
diers. These are the leaders of city
guard units and other small military
groups in castles and armies.


Human, Soldier

_Armor Class_ : 7 [12]
_Hit Dice_ : 1
_Attacks_ : Weapon
_Special_ : None
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 1/15

Human soldiers serve as city guard,
mercenaries, and men-at-arms. They
are generally armed with leather ar-
mor and a mace, sword, or spear. For
every five city guards there is usually
a sergeant.

Hydra

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 5–12 (equals # of heads)
_Attacks_ : 5–12 bites
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 9
_HDE/XP_ : 6/400; 7/600; 8/800;
9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700;
12/2,000; 13/2,300

Hydrae are great lizard-like or snake-
like creatures with 5–12 heads. Each
head has one hit die of its own, and
when the head is killed, that head dies.
The body has as many hit dice as the
total of the heads, so it is a matter of
good strategy for adventurers to focus
either on killing heads (when all the
heads are dead the body dies) or kill-
ing the creature by attacking the body
(in which case the heads die, too).
Hydrae that breathe fire or regenerate
their heads are known to exist.

Invisible Stalker


Armor Class : 3 [16]
Hit Dice : 8
Attacks : Bite
Special : Flight, invisibility
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 9/1,100


Invisible stalkers are generally only
found as a result of the spell Invisible
Stalker. They are invisible flying be-
ings created to follow a single com-
mand made by the caster.

Kobold


Armor Class : 6 [13]
Hit Dice : 1/2
Attacks : Weapon
Special : None
Move : 6
HDE/XP : < 1/10


Kobolds are subterranean, vaguely
goblin-like humanoids. They have
a -1 “to-hit” penalty when fighting
above ground. Many use slings or
short bows, and they fight with short
swords or spiked clubs in melee com-
bat.

Kraken


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 15
Attacks : Tentacle (2d6) or Bite (4d6)
Special : Swallow Whole
Move : 15 swimming
HDE/XP : 15/2,900


These massive sea monsters resemble
unimaginably large squids with eight
(or more) wiggling appendages. They
attack entire vessels, ripping them
apart and swallowing crew whole


with their massive, tooth filled maw.
When a kraken attacks, it grabs a tar-
get with one of its tentacles on round
one, attempts to bite them on round
two, and then swallows them whole
on round three. A target who has
been swallowed whole is slain. Krak-
ens typically have eight tentacles and
can make an attack with each one of
them every combat round.

Lich

_Armor Class_ : 0 [19]
_Hit Dice_ : 12–18
_Attacks_ : Touch
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 6
_HDE/XP_ : 15/2,900; 16/3,200;
17/3,500; 18/3,800; 19/4,100;
20/4,400; 21/4,700

Liches are the undead remnants of
wizards, either made undead by their
own deliberate acts during life or
as the result of other magical forces


(possibly including their own magics
gone awry). A lich has the same spell-
casting powers as the original Magic-
user (the same level as the lich’s HD).
A lich’s touch causes paralysis with
no saving throw, and the very sight
of one of these dread creatures causes
paralysis in any being of 4 HD or
below. Liches are highly malign and
intelligent.

Lizardman


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 2+1
Attacks : Claw or sword
Special : See below
Move : 6/12 (when swimming)
HDE/XP : 2/30


Lizardmen are reptilian humanoids,
usually living in tribal villages in the
depths of fetid swamps. Some can
hold their breath for a long duration
(an hour or more), while others can
actually breathe underwater. Some
lizardmen wield a wicked sword made
of sharp bone.

## Lycanthropes


Lycanthropes are were-creatures,
particularly those in whom the dis-
ease permits assumption of a hybrid
form of the human and animal. They
cannot be hit by normal weapons;
only silver or magical weapons inflict
damage on them. If any character is
brought below 50% hit points by a ly-
canthrope, the character will become
a lycanthrope himself.


Lycanthrope, Werebear

_Armor Class_ : 2 [17]
_Hit Dice_ : 7+3
_Attacks_ : Bite (1d6+1)
_Special_ : Lycanthropy
_Move_ : 9
_HDE/XP_ : 8/800

Werebears are often found in temper-
ate forests.

Lycanthrope, Wererat

_Armor Class_ : 6 [13]
_Hit Dice_ : 3
_Attacks_ : Weapon
_Special_ : Control rats, lycanthropy
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 4/120

Wererats are mostly found in cities,
lurking in shadowy alleyways. Were-
rats can control rats, and are extreme-
ly stealthy (surprising opponents 1–4
on a d6).

Lycanthrope, Werewolf


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 3
Attacks : Bite or Claw
Special : Lycanthropy
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 4/120


Werewolves are the traditional Ly-
canthropes seen in horror movies.
They are often only affected by silver
or magical weapons, and are often
humanoid—except for during a full
moon, and so on.

Manticore


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 6+4
Attacks : Bite (1d6+1), or Tail-spikes
(1d6)
Special : Flight
Move : 12/8(when flying)
HDE/XP : 8/800


A horrid monster with bat wings, the
face of a feral human, the body of a
lion, and a tail tipped with 24 iron
spikes. The manticore can hurl up to
6 of the iron spikes from its tail per
round, at a maximum range of 180
feet.

Medusa


Armor Class : 8 [11]
Hit Dice : 6
Attacks : Poisoned bite or weapon
Special : Petrifying gaze
Move : 9
HDE/XP : 8/800


Medusae are horrid creatures from
Greek mythology with a female face
but hair of writhing snakes; they have


no legs, but the body of a serpent. The
gaze of a medusa turns anyone look-
ing upon it into stone. In addition to
the medusa’s relatively weak melee-
weapon attack, the snake-hair makes
one attack per round, causing no
damage but lethally poisonous with a
successful hit (saving throw applies).

Minotaur

_Armor Class_ : 6 [13]
_Hit Dice_ : 6+4
_Attacks_ : Weapon (1d6+1)
_Special_ : Never lost in labyrinths
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 6/400

The minotaur is a human-eating
predator from Greek mythology, with
the head of a bull and the body of a
massive human, covered in shaggy
hair. Sometimes they wield large axes
and most are not particularly intelli-
gent.

Mummy

_Armor Class_ : 3 [16]
_Hit Dice_ : 5+1
_Attacks_ : Touch (See below)
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 6
_HDE/XP_ : 7/600

Mummies cannot be hit by normal
weapons and even magical weap-
ons inflict only half damage against
them. Their touch also inflicts a rot-
ting disease which prevents magical
healing and causes wounds to heal at
one-tenth of the normal rate. A Cure
Disease spell can increase healing rate
to half normal, but a Remove Curse
spell is required to completely lift the
mummy’s curse.

Nightsteed


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 5+5
Attacks : Flaming Hooves (2d6)
Special : Fearful Cry
Move : 15 (18 when flying)
HDE/XP : 5/240


A nightsteed is a black horse with
burning red eyes and a mane of fire.
Its hooves also burn with hellfire and
it can fly as easily as run. They attack
with their flaming hooves, and once
per day can let out a terrible cry that
requires all who hear it to make a
saving throw or flee in terror of the
nightsteed for 1d6 rounds.

Nymph


Armor Class : 7 [12]
Hit Dice : 3
Attacks : None
Special : See Below
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 4/120


Nymphs are fey who appear as leaf-
clad or nude women of unimaginable
beauty. They dwell in the deep parts
of the forest and seek to protect wild
places in the world. Any men who
gaze upon them must make a saving
throw at a -4 penalty or fall com-
pletely under their thrall. Nymphs
will lead wayward travelers away from
their beloved woods and malicious
foes to their deaths, often drowning
them in woodland lakes while they
are enchanted. Nymphs are invisible
while in the woods as long as they
remain still, blending seamlessly into
their surroundings.


Ochre Jelly

_Armor Class_ : 8 [11]
_Hit Dice_ : 5
_Attacks_ : Acid strike
_Special_ : Lightning divides creature
_Move_ : 3
_HDE/XP_ : 6/400

Ochre jellies are amorphous oozes
that damage opponents with their
acidic surface. They dissolve any ad-
venturers they kill, making the spell
Raise Dead all but impossible.

Ogre

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 4+1
_Attacks_ : Weapon (1d6+1)
_Special_ : None
_Move_ : 9
_HDE/XP_ : 4/120

Ogres are normally quite stupid, but
more intelligent versions might be
encountered here and there. Some-
times ogres are mistaken for trolls.

Ogre Mage

_Armor Class_ : 4 [15]
_Hit Dice_ : 5+4
_Attacks_ : Weapon (1d6+1)
_Special_ : Magic
_Move_ : 12/18 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 7/600

The ogre mage is an ogre with magic
powers, based on Japanese legend. An
ogre mage can fly, turn invisible (per
the spell), create a 10 foot radius circle
of magical darkness, change into hu-
man form, cast Sleep and Charm Per-
son once per day, and cast a cone of
frost with a range of 60 feet to a base


of 30 feet, causing 8d6 damage to any
caught within (saving throw applies).
Western folklore also contains many
examples of shape-shifting, magi-
cal ogres (the most famous example
being the one in Puss-in-Boots), so
there might be many different types
of magical ogres, whether or not they
are called “ogre mage.”

Orc


Armor Class : 6 [13]
Hit Dice : 1
Attacks : Weapon
Special : None
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 1/15


Orcs are stupid, brutish humanoids
that gather in tribes of hundreds.
Most are subterranean dwellers, and
fight with a -1 penalty “to-hit” in sun-
light. Occasionally, war-bands or even
entire tribes of orcs issue forth from
their caverns to raid and pillage by
night. Orcish leaders are great brutes
with additional HD, and magic-using
shamans may also be found in the
larger tribes. Orcish tribes hate each
other, and will fight savagely unless
restrained by a powerful and feared
commander, such as an evil high
priest or a mystic sorcerer.


Pegasus

_Armor Class_ : 6 [13]
_Hit Dice_ : 2+2
_Attacks_ : Hooves
_Special_ : Flight
_Move_ : 24/42 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 4/120

Pegasus was the winged horse from
Greek mythology. Other Pegasus
creatures might have bat wings, some
might be chaotic; such choices are left
entirely up to the Referee.

Purple Worm

_Armor Class_ : 6 [13]
_Hit Dice_ : 15
_Attacks_ : Bite (2d6) or sting
_Special_ : Poison sting
_Move_ : 9
_HDE/XP_ : 17/3,500

Purple worms are massive annelids
that grow 40+ feet in length and
sometimes exceed 10 feet in width.
They are subterranean, chewing tun-
nels in rock (or through sand, in des-
erts, where they are a tan color). These
beasts swallow their prey whole on a
roll 4 higher than the needed num-
ber, or if the worm rolls double the
number required “to-hit”. They can
swallow anything the size of a horse
or smaller.

In addition to the worm’s dreaded
bite, it has a poison stinger on its
tail, the length of a sword and just as
deadly even from the piercing wound
it inflicts. The poison injected by the
stinger is lethal if the victim fails a
saving throw. What prey the purple
worms once hunted (or perhaps still
do, in deep places) with such natural


weapons must have been terrifying
indeed. Aquatic versions of the purple
worm might also exist.

Rat, Giant


Armor Class : 7 [12]
Hit Dice : 1-1
Attacks : Bite
Special : 5% are diseased
Move : 12
HDE/XP : < 1/10


Giant rats are often found in dun-
geons, and are about the size of a
cat or a lynx. The bite of some (1 in
20) giant rats causes disease. A sav-
ing throw vs. poison is allowed. The
effects of the disease are decided by
the Referee.

Roc


Armor Class : 4 [15]
Hit Dice : 12
Attacks : Claw (1d6+2)
Special : None
Move : 3/48 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 12/2,000


Rocs are the mythological great birds
of legend, large enough to prey upon
elephants. They can be trained as
fledglings to serve as steeds, so roc
eggs or fledglings would be a prize in-


deed, worth great sums of gold. Rocs
might grow as large as 18 HD, with
commensurately increased statistics.

Salamander

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14], 3 [16]
_Hit Dice_ : 7
_Attacks_ : Constrict or touch
_Special_ : Heat, constriction
_Move_ : 9
_HDE/XP_ : 8/800

Salamanders are intelligent creatures
of the elemental planes of fire. They
have the upper body of a human (AC
5 [14]) and the lower body of a snake
(AC 3 [16]), and give off tremen-
dous, intense heat. The very touch of
a salamander deals 1d6 hit points of
fire damage, and they wrap their tails
around foes to cause an additional
2d6 points of crushing damage per
round. Salamanders cannot be en-
slaved in the same manner djinn and
efreet might be.

Sea Serpent

_Armor Class_ : 2 [17]
_Hit Dice_ : 30
_Attacks_ : Bite (3d6)
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 18 (when swimming)
_HDE/XP_ : 30/8,400

The size and nature of sea serpents is
a matter for the Referee to determine.
The sea serpent depicted here would
be about medium size, about 60 feet
in length, with smaller ones being
half that size (with adjusted statistics,
of course), and large ones being about
50% larger than the one described
here. A sea serpent would undoubt-
edly be capable of swallowing a hu-


man whole, probably on a natural at-
tack roll of 14 or greater. A character
swallowed whole would be digested
within, perhaps, three hours.

Shadow


Armor Class : 7 [12]
Hit Dice : 3+3
Attacks : Touch (See below)
Special : See below
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 4/120


Shadows may or may not be undead
creatures: they are immune to sleep
and charm, but the Referee may de-
cide whether they are undead crea-
tures subject to turning or whether
they are some horrible “other” thing,
a manifestation perhaps, or a creature
from another dimension. Shadows are
dark and resemble shadows, though
they may be darker. They are not
corporeal, and can only be harmed
with magical weapons or by spells.
Their chill touch drains one point of
strength with a successful hit, and if
a victim is brought to a strength of 0,
he becomes a shadow. Strength points
return after 90 minutes.

Sidhe


Armor Class : 3 [17]
Hit Dice : 5
Attacks : Fey Blade (2d6)
Special : See Below
Move : 12
HDE/XP : 7/600


Sidhe are noble fey who rarely travel
the mortal realm. They appear as tall
elfin beings of amazing beauty and
are clad in shining mail and glorious
raiment. All who look upon them are


struck blind by their beauty unless a
successful saving throw is made. Sid-
he attack with their magical fey blades
which do 2d6 points of damage and
may cast Alter Time, Invisibility, and
Phantasmal Force each once per day.
They are also highly resistant to mor-
tal magic and have a +5 bonus to all
saving throws made to resist it.

Skeleton

_Armor Class_ : 8 [11], 7 [12] w/ shield
_Hit Dice_ : 1/2
_Attacks_ : Strike or weapon
_Special_ : None
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : <1/10

Skeletons are animated bones of the
dead and are usually under the control
of some evil master.

Slug, Giant


Armor Class : 8 [11]
Hit Dice : 12
Attacks : Bite
Special : Spits acid (2d6)
Move : 6
HDE/XP : 13/2,300


These tremendously large masses of
slimy, rubbery flesh are completely
immune to blunt weapons. In addi-
tion to their powerful bite, giant slugs
can spit their acidic saliva (one target
at a time). The base range for spitting
is 60 feet, and within this range the
slug’s spittle will be 50% likely “to-
hit” (no “to-hit” roll required). For
every additional 10 feet of range, the
chance “to-hit” decreases by 10%. On
its first spitting attack, the slug only
has a 10% chance “to-hit” within 60
feet, and no chance of hitting beyond
that range. Some giant slugs might
have more or less virulent acidity
(thus changing the damage inflicted).

Spectre


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 6
Attacks : Touch (See below)
Special : Drains 2 levels per hit
Move : 15/30 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 9/1,100


Spectres are wraith-like undead crea-
tures without corporeal bodies. When
a spectre hits an opponent, either with
hand or weapon, the touch drains two
levels from the victim. Only magi-
cal weapons can damage a spectre. In
some cases, these terrifying creatures
may be mounted upon living beasts, if
the beasts have been trained to toler-
ate proximity to the undead. Any be-


ing killed (or drained below level 0)
by a specter becomes a spectre him-
self—a pitiful thrall to its creator.

Spider, Giant

_Armor Class_ : 6 [13]
_Hit Dice_ : 2+2
_Attacks_ : Bite (See below)
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 18
_HDE/XP_ : 5/240

Giant spiders are aggressive hunters.
Only the greater giant spiders are web
builders. Giant spider webs require a
saving throw to avoid becoming stuck.
Those who make their saving throw
can fight and move (5 feet per round)
in the webs. Giant spiders surprise on
a roll of 1–5, being able to hide well in
shadows. A giant spider’s bite is very
poisonous.

Stirge

_Armor Class_ : 5 [14]
_Hit Dice_ : 1-1
_Attacks_ : Sting (1d6-1)
_Special_ : Suck Blood
_Move_ : 15 while flying
_HDE/XP_ : 1/15

These tiny birds have needle-like
beaks which they use to impale their
victims and then drain them of blood.
Whenever a stirge makes a successful
melee attack they remain attached to
their target and automatically inflict
1d6-1 points of damage each round as
they drink the victim’s blood.

Treant


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 7–12
Attacks : Strike
Special : Control trees
Move : 6
HDE/XP : 7/600; 8/800; 9/1,100;
10/1,400; 11/1,700; 12/2,000


Treants are tree-like protectors and
“shepherds” of forest trees. Depend-
ing upon their size, they have different
hit dice and damage; treants of 7 to 8
hit dice inflict 2d6 points of damage
with each strike of their branch-like
hands, treants of 9–10 hit dice inflict
3d6 points, and treants of 11–12 hit
dice inflict 4d6 points. All treants can
“wake” trees within 60 feet, allowing
them to walk at a rate of 3, and possi-
bly to attack (no more than two trees
at a time can be awake at the behest
of a single treant)


Troll

_Armor Class_ : 4 [15]
_Hit Dice_ : 6+3
_Attacks_ : Claw (1d6+2)
_Special_ : Regeneration
_Move_ : 12
_HDE/XP_ : 8/800

Trolls are as tall as ogres and just as
strong. Unlike ogres, however, they
attack with claws and teeth instead
of weapons. Trolls regenerate, which
is to say that any damage inflicted
upon them heals within minutes (3
hit points per round). The only way
to utterly kill a troll is to submerse it
in acid or burn it. Trolls can even re-
grow lopped-off heads and limbs.

Unicorn

_Armor Class_ : 2 [17]
_Hit Dice_ : 4
_Attacks_ : Hoof or horn
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 24
_HDE/XP_ : 5/240

Unicorns are generally shy and be-
nevolent creatures, who will only al-
low a chaste maiden to approach
them. They can teleport once per day


to a distance of 360 feet, with a rider.
When they charge, their horn can
deal double damage. Unicorns are
25% resistant to magic. The unicorn’s
horn has healing properties according
to legend (the details of this, if any, are
left to the Referee). There is consider-
able room to create variants of sorts:
evil or flying unicorns, etc.

Vampire


Armor Class : 2 [17]
Hit Dice : 7–9
Attacks : Bite (See below)
Special : See below
Move : 12/18 (when flying)
HDE/XP : 9/1,100; 10/1,400;
11/1,700


Vampires are some of the most pow-
erful of undead creatures. They can
only be hit with magic weapons and


when “killed” in this way they change
into a gaseous form, returning to their
coffins.

They regenerate at a rate of 3 hit
points per round, can turn into gas-
eous form or into a giant bat at will,
and can summon a horde of bats or
3d6 wolves out from the night. Look-
ing into a vampire’s eyes necessitates
a saving throw at -2, or the character
is charmed (as per the spell Charm
Person). Most terrifyingly, a vampire’s
bite drains two levels from the victim.

Fortunately, vampires have some
weaknesses. They can be killed (these
are the only known methods) by im-
mersing them in running water, ex-
posing them to sunlight, or driving a
wooden stake through the heart. They
retreat from the smell of garlic, the
sight of a mirror, or the sight of “good”
holy symbols. Any human killed by a
vampire becomes a vampire under the
control of its creator. This description
will be recognized easily as the “Drac-
ula” type of vampire.

Many other possibilities for vampires
exist in folklore: Chinese vampires,
for instance, and blood-drinkers more
feral than intelligent. Plus, other cul-
tural templates with different attri-
butes could be created—how about
an ancient Egyptian mummified
vampire, or an Aztec vampire?

Wight


Armor Class : 5 [14]
Hit Dice : 3
Attacks : Claw (See below)
Special : See below
Move : 9
HDE/XP : 5/240


Wights live in tombs, graveyards, and
burial mounds (barrows). They are
undead, and thus not affected by sleep
or charm spells. Wights are immune
to all non-magical weapons, with the
exception of silver weapons. Any hu-
man killed or completely drained of
levels (1 level per hit) by a wight be-
comes a wight.

Worg


Armor Class : 6 [13]
Hit Dice : 4
Attacks : Bite
Special : None
Move : 18
HDE/XP : 4/120


Worgs are large, intelligent, and evil
wolves of chaos. They are sometimes
ridden by orcs. They may have super-
natural origins.


Wraith

_Armor Class_ : 3 [16]
_Hit Dice_ : 4
_Attacks_ : Touch (See below)
_Special_ : See below
_Move_ : 24
_HDE/XP_ : 6/400

Wraiths are powerful wights, im-
mune to all non-magical weapons
other than silver ones (which inflict
only half damage). Arrows are par-
ticularly ineffective against them, for
even magical and silver arrows inflict
only one hit point of damage per hit.
They drain 1 level per hit. Wraiths can
be found riding well-trained battle
steeds or more unusual mounts that
will tolerate their presence.

Wyvern

_Armor Class_ : 3 [16]
_Hit Dice_ : 7
_Attacks_ : Bite or sting
_Special_ : Flight, poison sting
_Move_ : 6/24 (when flying)
_HDE/XP_ : 9/1,100

A wyvern is the two-legged form of
dragon, and these creatures are small-
er and less intelligent than true four-
legged dragons, not to mention that
they do not have a breath weapon.
Wyverns have a poisonous sting at the
end of their tails, but they are not co-
ordinated enough to attack with both
bite and sting in a single round. In any
given round, the wyvern is 60% likely
to use its tail, which can lash out to
the creature’s front even farther than
its head can reach.

Yellow Mold


Armor Class : N/A
Hit Dice : N/A
Attacks : See below
Special : Poisonous spores
Move : 0
HDE/XP : 3/60


Yellow mold is a subterranean fungus;
it neither moves nor attacks. How-
ever, if it is poked or struck, it may
(50% chance) release a cloud of poi-
sonous spores, roughly 10 feet in di-
ameter. Failing a saving throw against
the spores means that the character
dies a rather horrible death. Touch-
ing yellow mold causes 1d6 points of
acid damage. These growths can be
destroyed with fire.

Zombie


Armor Class : 8 [11], 7 [12] w/ shield
Hit Dice : 1
Attacks : Strike or weapon
Special : Immune to sleep, charm
Move : 6
HDE/XP : 2/30


Zombies are mindless creatures, the
walking dead. These are merely ani-
mated corpses, not carriers of any sort
of undead contagion as ghouls are.
If their undeath is contagious, they
should be worth a few more experi-
ence points than described here, and
if a single hit from a zombie causes
contagion or any other sort of disease
they should be worth considerably
more experience. However, the stan-
dard zombie is simply a corpse ani-
mated to do its creator’s bidding.


##### Tougher Monsters

There is really no limit as to how high monsters can go, and often it’s fun to
trick the players by throwing über-monsters at them. The Referee should feel
free to adjust AC, HD, or other factors to make monsters more challenging.
Also, feel free to try new options
like a super strain of orcs, goblin
spider-riders, or fire-resistant
mummies just to keep the play-
ers on their toes.

##### Monster Levels

You may notice that while
suggested character levels are
capped, monster levels are not.
The reasons for this are simple:


 Players run in packs and big
monsters need levels to overcome
a disadvantage in numbers.


 Players tend to be creative
while many Referees allow mon-
sters to “play stupid.”

The Referee has the option of
allowing characters to continue
to advance, or to put a cap on
monster levels as he or she sees
fit.

###### Creating Monsters

Monsters are not Player Characters, and their abilities are not at all determined
by the rules for PCs—not even the stats for races that can have player charac-
ters, such as Dwarves. A monster’s abilities are determined by the Referee, not
by any rules! Feel free to add wings, breath weapons, extra hit dice, wounded
versions, or whatever suits your adventure and your campaign. Toggle and
tweak, imagine and invent! You are responsible for the quality of the swords
and sorcery in your game, not the rules. So don’t try to create monsters accord-
ing to any sort of power formula. Create monsters based on how they feel and
how they play at the gaming table. Create challenges for the players, not head-
aches for yourself. Your job is to imagine and create, not to slave at rulebooks
finding out what you’re “allowed” to do.

The amount of treasure a monster owns or guards is usually related to the
monster’s HDE. That’s not necessarily realistic, but keep in mind that treasure
is one of the ways the game reflects what a character has done: it’s used in
awarding experience points. Too many large treasures and the characters will
become powerful without actually having done very much. Too many monsters
with small treasures and the characters won’t gain levels to reflect their achieve-
ments.

As a general guideline, the monetary value of a treasure ought to be about 2–3
times the monster’s value in experience points, and keep in mind that hunt-
ing and patrolling monsters likely won’t be carting their treasure around with
them. If the characters can’t find the monster’s lair, they may get none of the
treasure. Also, it obviously doesn’t make sense for every wild boar and wolf to
have a cache of treasure hidden away somewhere. Averaging the treasure out
over several of the monsters in an adventure is a good way of making sure the
characters get the right amount of experience points from treasure. Perhaps the
goblin treasure hoard contains some “extra” treasure to account for the wolves
in the area. If the characters avoid the wolves and kill the goblins, so much
the better. If they have to fight the wolves and never find the goblins, then the
treasure is there for them to find next time.

# Chapter^9

## Treasure


Here is a table a Referee can use as a guideline to help create a treasure:


* The total value of treasure
is expressed in terms of gold
coins. If the total value of
treasure was 100 XP on a
roll of 1, the recipient would
receive 20 gp, 300 sp, and
5,000 cp

Remember that coins found are not always gold pieces—there might be a mix-
ture of copper (cp) and silver pieces (sp) in the treasure as well. The treasure
breakdown given in the prior Treasure Values table is a suggested guideline to
how you might consider breaking up the treasure. One gold piece (gp) is worth
10 silver pieces (sp) or 100 copper pieces (cp).

##### Splitting the Take

Once the monsters are slain and the wounds are bound, it’s time to divide up
the treasure. It is suggested that the total gp value of the loot is totaled and
divided up among the participants with each getting an equal “share.” Many
Referees rule that treasure must be shared with NPCs getting either a full or
half share, depending upon their level. It is also customary for fallen (dead)
companions to still get a share of the take to be given to their next of kin.

##### Treasure Items

In addition to coins, treasures might contain gems, jewelry, and magical items.
Treasures should be interesting—an endless series of “another treasure worth
100 gp in total” is a sure-fire recipe for boring your players.


 For every 5,000 gp in value , there is a 10% chance of trading out 5,000 gp for
an item on either the Major Gem/Jewelry or Major Magic table.
 For every 1,000 gp in value , there is a 1 0% chance of trading out 1,000 gp for
an item on either the Medium Gem/Jewelry or Medium Magic table.
 For every 100 gp in value , there is a 10% chance of trading out 100 gp for an
item on either the Minor Gem/Jewelry or Minor Magic table.

Calculate the total percentage of treasure that can be traded out and roll a d100
to see if you can roll for an item on one of the following tables. It is suggested
that the Referee begin with the 5,000 gp values and work down to the 100 gp
values. “Jewelry” refers to a single item of jewelry.

Always remember that these tables are merely guidelines—if you desire the
placement of a particular item or treasure type, go ahead and do it! If you don’t
wish to include gems, jewelry, or magic items, then leave the treasure at coins.
These tables are here only to help when wanted.


Table 44: Treasure Value
Roll Total Value* CP SP GP
1 XP × 1 50% 30% 20%
2–3 XP × 2 20% 50% 30%
4–5 XP × 3 10% 40% 50%
6 XP × 4 – 25% 75%


##### Treasure Trade Out (Example #1)

If you populate an area with 5 skeletons, their total XP value would be 75. If
you were to roll against the Treasure Values table and get a 4, the total trea-
sure value for that encounter is 225 gp and the break out would be (rounded
down): 112 gp, 900 sp, and 2,250 cp. There is a 10% chance of trading out 100
gp of that treasure for one minor item. If, on a d100, you roll under 10%, then
the treasure value of that encounter would be 12 gp, 900 sp, 2,250 cp, and one
minor item (as rolled on the Minor Gem/Jewelry or Minor Magic table).

##### Treasure Trade Out (Example #2)

You place a fearsome minotaur in a locked dungeon room for a total of 400
XP. Rolling against the Treasure Values table, if you were to roll a 6, the total
treasure value for this encounter is 1,600 gp and the break out would be: 1,200
gp and 4,000 sp. There is a 10% chance of trading out 1,000 gp of that treasure
for one medium item. If, on a d100, you roll under 10%, then the treasure value
on that encounter would be 200 gp, 4,000 sp, and one medium item (as rolled
on the Medium Gem/Jewelry or Medium Magic table). With the remaining
total value in gold, there could either be a 60% chance to trade out 600 gp for
one minor item, six 10% chances to trade out 600 gp for a total of six minor
items, or some other variant like one 10% chance to trade out 100 gp for one
minor item (keeping the remaining 500 gp).

##### 5,000 gp Trade Out

A roll of 1–19 on a d20 means a roll on the Major Gem/Jewelry table. A roll

**Dust of Appearance or Disappearance (50%)** : Dust of Appearance is tossed
in a radius of 10 feet around the user, and makes any invisible, astral, displaced,
out-of-phase, or dimensional thing completely visible. The dust generally
comes in a pouch, with enough for 20–30 uses. Dust of Disappearance works
in the opposite way: when it is sprinkled in a 10 foot radius, everything therein
becomes invisible for 5d6 turns. Normal means of detecting invisibility (such
as a Detect Invisibility spell) are not strong enough to work against the dust’s
powerful enchantment. Usable by: All Classes.

**Dust of Sneezing and Choking** : Pouches containing this dust ordinarily con-
tain only enough for one “dose.” When scattered in a radius of 10 feet, the dust
causes all in the area to make a saving throw or die. If the nature of the dust is
identified before it is experimented with, it can be used as a devastating thrown
weapon. Usable by: All Classes.

**Efreeti Bottle** : The efreeti of the bottle will serve
the bottle’s owner for a year and a day unless it is
accidentally released from servitude. Usable by: All
Classes.

**Figurine of the Golden Lions** : A small stone
figurine that transforms into a lion when the
command word is spoken, fighting at the own-
er’s orders. If it is slain, it turns back into a figu-
rine, but may be used again. The figurine may be
used once per week, and no more. Usable by:
All Classes.

**Figurine of the Onyx Dog:** This stone
figure transforms into a living hound of
stone when its command word is spoken. It will seek whatever the owner tells
it to find, without stopping until it succeeds or is killed. It has a 75% chance to
detect objects that are invisible or hidden (and of course its sense of smell de-
tects invisible and hidden creatures with almost perfect success). For purposes
of defense and attack, the stone dog is treated as a wolf. It may be used twelve
times before the statuette becomes non-magical. Usable by: All Classes.

**Gauntlets of Dexterity** : When worn, these gloves grant a bonus of +2 to the
wearer’s dexterity (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Gauntlets of Ogre Power** : These gauntlets raise the wearer’s strength to that
of an ogre. Hit probability is not increased above normal, but damage bonuses
from strength are increased to +4 (not cumulative with the wearer’s existing
strength bonus, if any). Usable by: all but Magic-users.


**Gauntlets of Swimming and Climbing** : These gloves permit the wearer to
swim at a rate of 18, and climb sheer walls with a 95% chance of success per
ten feet of climbing. Usable by: all but Magic-users.

**Gem of Seeing** : A gem of seeing is used as a lens, and shows the truth of what
it sees, cutting through illusions of all kinds, even very powerful ones. Usable
by: All Classes.

**Girdle of Giant Strength** : This wide belt grants the wearer the strength of a
hill giant (+8 strength damage, not cumulative with any existing strength bo-
nuses). It does not increase “to-hit” probability. Usable by: All Classes.

**Helm of Fiery Brilliance** : This prodigiously powerful helm
grants many benefits to the wearer. He gains a +10 on
saving throws against fire damage, and can create a
Wall of Fire himself. Fighters wearing the helm
may command a weapon in hand to flame (+1d6
damage). Magic-users wearing the helm can
add +1 to each die of damage inflicted by
a Fireball spell. Clerics wearing the helm
can ignite objects within 30 feet at will,
and may cast two Light or Continual
Light spells for each one actually pre-
pared. The wearer of this helm is likely
to be attacked by any air elemental
creatures, but fire elemental types
(such as efreet or salamanders) will
be favorably disposed toward the wearer.
Usable by: All Classes.

**Helm of Reading Magic and Languages** : The wearer can read all languages,
including magic script. Usable by: All Classes.

**Helm of Teleportation** : When the wearer casts a Teleportation spell on him-
self, while wearing the helm, he may teleport himself without error, anywhere
he desires. The helm does not permit the casting of a Teleportation spell on
anyone other than the wearer. Usable by: Magic-users.

**Hole, Portable** : A piece of dark cloth about five feet in diameter. It is actually
the mouth of an inter-dimensional hole 10 feet deep—items and people can
fall through it or climb down into it once it is placed on the ground. The piece
of cloth can actually be pulled in from the inside to close the hole off entirely,
although there is no source of fresh air within, and staying inside will asphyxi-
ate the inhabitant in a short time. The piece of cloth can be picked up and car-
ried off whenever desired—hence the name “portable.” Usable by: All Classes.


**Horn of Blasting** : This horn, when blown, has the same effect on structures as
a catapult, and causes 2d6 points of damage to creatures, deafening them for
10 minutes as well. The cone of sound is 100 feet long, and widens to a base of
20 feet (the “point” of the cone, at the horn’s mouth, is 10 feet wide). Usable
by: All Classes.

**Horn of Valhalla, Bronze** : Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (3 HD) to assist
the one who winded the horn. Usable by: Fighters and Clerics only.

**Horn of Valhalla, Iron** : Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (4 HD) to assist the
one who winded the horn. Usable by: Fighters.

**Horn of Valhalla, Silver** : Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (2 HD) to assist the
one who winded the horn. Usable by: All Classes.

**Horseshoes of Speed** : Double a horse’s movement rate. Usable by: Horses.

**Jug of Alchemy** : This jug produces whatever liquid is desired, in a commonly
used large quantity (e.g., 10 gallons of water, but only five gallons of wine). It
may be used no more than 7 times per day, and will only produce the liquid
first requested in that day. It does not produce magical liquids. Usable by: All
Classes.

**Lenses of Charming** : These lenses, when placed over the eyes, give the wearer
the ability to charm those who look into his eyes (as per a Charm Person spell).
The saving throw against the power of the lenses is made at -2. Usable by: All
Classes.

**Libram, magical (level gain)** : Magical librams grant a level of experience to
the reader, if the reader is of the right class. Randomly determine the class for
which the libram is written.

**Luckstone** : This stone grants +1 to saving throws and “to-hit” rolls. Usable by:
All Classes.

**Manual of Beneficial Exercise** : Reading this tome increases the reader’s
strength by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Golems** : This book contains the basic instructions and formulae for
creating a single type of golem. The process is expensive, and the creator must
have achieved a certain level of magical expertise in order to use the book, but
these are priceless repositories of forgotten lore. Such books are often warded,
by the original owner, from the touch of anyone not of the Magic-user class,
enchanted to inflict damage or even the loss of a level. Usable by: Magic-users
o n l y.


**Manual of Intelligence** : Reading this tome increases the reader’s intelligence
by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Quickness** : Reading this tome increases the reader’s dexterity by 1
point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Wisdom** : Reading this tome increases the reader’s wisdom by 1
point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Medallion of Detect Thoughts (ESP)** : Functions as a Detect Thoughts (ESP)
spell within 30 feet (75%) or 90 feet (25%). Usable by: All Classes.

**Mirror of Mental Scrying** : This hand-mirror (it might also be found as a
smaller mirror on a necklace) allows the user to cast Clairaudience, Clairvoy-
ance, and Detect Thoughts (ESP), with the normal range, but for an unlimited
time. The mirror will also answer a question about what it portrays (the answer
is likely to be quite cryptic), but only one question per week is possible. Usable
by: All Classes.

**Necklace of Fireballs** : This necklace is hung with 3d4 little baubles. When
thrown, the baubles explode into 6d6 fireballs (per the spell). Usable by: All
Classes.

**Pipes of the Sewers** : These pipes summon 10d6 giant rats. The piper does not
need to concentrate once the rats arrive (which takes 1d4 × 10 minutes), but it
is wise to do so. When the rats arrive, there is a 5% chance that they will not
obey him, and if he ceases to concentrate on his tune there is a 10% chance
that he will lose control of them. Every subsequent round in which he fails to
concentrate there is another chance to lose control, and the chance increases
by 10% each time it is made (first round, 10%, second round 20%, etc.). Usable
by: All Classes.

**Robe of Blending** : These robes make the wearer appear to be a part of his sur-
roundings, including the ability to appear as another one of a group of nearby
creatures. He will appear to be a small tree when in forest surroundings, a sand
formation in the desert, etc. Creatures with 10+ hit dice (or levels of experi-
ence) have a 10% chance per level (or HD) above 9th to perceive the wearer as
a robed figure rather than a part of the surroundings. Usable by: All Classes.

**Robe of Eyes** : Hundreds of eyes are woven and embroidered into the fabric of
these magical robes, granting the wearer tremendous powers of supernatural
perception. In a radius of 240 feet, anything he looks upon is seen for what it
is: he sees invisible creatures, he perceives illusions, and his sight even extends
into the astral plane. He cannot be ambushed or otherwise taken by surprise,
and he can follow the trail of anything that has passed by within the last day.
Usable by: Magic-users only.


**Robe of Wizardry** : This robe grants the wearer the ability to cast Charm, Poly-
morph, and Hold Person with a 95% chance of success. The robes may be tied
to specific alignments. Usable by: Magic-users only.

**Rope of Climbing** : A 50 foot length of rope that leaps magically upward and
can tie and untie itself upon command. Usable by: All Classes.

**Rope of Entanglement** : This rope, on command, twines itself around as many
as 2d4+1 human-sized foes. The rope cannot be hit except with a natural roll
of 20 (it is magical), and can sustain 20 hit points of damage before fraying and
becoming useless. Usable by: All Classes.

**Spade of Excavation** : This ordinary-looking spade digs by itself when com-
manded, shoveling out 1 cubic yard (3 x 3 x 3) per ten minutes. Usable by:
Fighters.

**Symbol—Scarab of Insanity** : This is a carving of a scarab-beetle, or perhaps
the petrified remains of a real one. When the scarab is displayed, all creatures
with 9 or fewer hit dice, within a radius of 30 feet, fall into temporary insan-
ity lasting for 2 hours. Creatures with 10+ hit dice still do not receive a saving
throw, but have a 1 in 4 chance to overcome the scarab’s insidious influence.
The scarab may be used 12 times, after which it crumbles to dust. At the option
of the Referee, it might be recharged but with a 5% chance per charge that the
item will be destroyed. Usable by: All Classes.

###### Cursed Items

Cursed items come in many
shapes and forms—most likely
they are ancient magical items
whose magic has deteriorated
or changed with age, although
some of them were clearly fash-
ioned to serve as traps for the
unwary (or for the maker’s ene-
mies, perhaps). Note that cursed
items cannot usually be dropped
or removed without the assis-
tance of a Remove Curse spell.
Although the Referee is encour-
aged to create his own cursed
items, the samples on the fol-
lowing page should prove useful
guidance:


Table 70: Cursed Items
Roll Cursed Items
1 Bag of Devouring
2 Censer of Hostile Elementals
3 Cloak of Poison
4 Crystal Ball of Suggestion
5 Dancing Boots
6 Flask of Stoppered Curses
7 Horn of Collapse
8 Medallion of Projecting Thoughts
9 Mirror of Opposition
10 Robe of Feeblemindedness


##### Cursed Item Descriptions

**Bag of Devouring** : Functions as a bag of holding, but devours any item placed
into it within 1d4+1 hours.

**Censer of Hostile Elementals** : A censer (or brazier, bowl, or stone) that sum-
mons elementals—but the elementals are hostile instead of under the sum-
moner’s control.

**Cloak of Poison** : Upon donning this cloak, the wearer’s body is suffused with
magical poisons of many kinds, and dies instantly, without the chance of a sav-
ing throw.

**Crystal Ball of Suggestion** : Does not function as a crystal ball, but implants
a suggestion in the viewer’s mind. Powerful versions of this item might even
implant a Quest.

**Dancing Boots** : These boots function as boots of Elvenkind or speed, until the
wearer is in combat or fleeing. Suddenly at that point he will begin to dance a
jig, or perhaps a stately waltz.

**Flask of Stoppered Curses** : This flask releases a curse of some kind when its
seal is broken.

**Horn of Collapse** : When sounded, this horn causes a blast of destruction
straight upwards, destroying any ceiling overhead and causing it to collapse.

**Medallion of Projecting Thoughts** : The wearer’s thoughts can be “heard” by
all nearby.

**Mirror of Opposition** : All persons looking into this mirror are attacked by
evil versions of themselves, exact duplicates including spells and magic items.
When the mirror-opposites are slain, their bodies and equipment disappear
into mist, and return to the mirror.

**Robe of Feeblemindedness** : Anyone donning this cloak has his intelligence
reduced to that of a garden snail.
