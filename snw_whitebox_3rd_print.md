**Introduction**


SWORDS & WIZARDRY: WHITEBOX is a fantasy role-playing game. The rules are extremely short compared to the multi-paged rule libraries required to play most modern games. Yet, this game contains within itself the soul of mythic fantasy and the kindling of wonder. The game is powerful because it’s encapsulated by such a small formula—like a genie imprisoned in the small compass of an unremarkable lamp. This game serves as a good introduction for those learning how to play fantasy games, and is the ultimate tool for the expert Referee who customizes his worlds with variant rules (as it’s always easier to add rules than to untangle them away).

And remember, with SWORDS & WIZARDRY: WHITEBOX, you are free to publish your own adventures, house-rules, and any other sort of materials designed for this game. Guidelines and requirements are at the end of the book.

– Matthew J. Finch

Like an archaeologist unearthing ancient ruins, my task was to uncover and preserve the very essence of what made role-playing so great during the genesis of the hobby. These rules are designed to maintain the spirit and philosophy of the oldest of gaming models, back in the days where rules weren’t supposed to be “complete”—because half of the fun was making up your own! 

I have been playing role-playing games since 1975, when I first discovered a fun game in a little white box, and I enjoy giving the reader of this book the opportunity to discover the flavor of what I found so many decades ago. I would like to thank Matthew Finch for giving me the opportunity to do this, Jason Cone for his wonderful suggestions, and, to quote Sir Isaac Newton: “If I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants.”

**Chapter 1**
## **Getting Started**

SWORDS & WIZARDRY: WHITEBOX requires two kinds of participants: (1) The Referee and (2) the Player. For Players, the first step in playing the game is to create a Player Character (PC). This is a simple matter of rolling some dice to determine your character’s strength and other basic attributes, picking a character class, and buying in-game equipment. If you’re the Referee, however, you’ve got a bit more preparation to do—that’s covered in Chapter 7.

### **Rule Number One**
The most important rule in SWORDS & WIZARDRY: WHITEBOX is that the Referee always has the right to modify the rules. In fact, it’s encouraged! This is your game, after all. There are gaps in the rules—holes left open on purpose—because much of the fun of “old school” gaming is being able to make up rules as needed.

### **Dice**
Swords & Wizardry: WhiteBox uses several different types of dice, and they are abbreviated herein according to the number of sides they have. For example, a four-sided die is noted as “d4.” If this text requires a player to roll “3d4” that means to roll three (3) four-sided dice and add the results together. Other die types (six-sided, eight-sided, ten-sided, twelve-sided, and twenty-sided) follow in the same manner. 

There is no die with 100 sides. When asked to roll d100, roll two (2) ten-sided dice, treating the first roll as the “tens” and the second as the “ones.” So, if one were to roll a “7” and then a “3”, the result would be “73.” 

The roll of two zeroes is treated as a result of “100,” so you cannot roll a “0” on percentile dice. The lowest result possible is a “1.”

### **About the Alternate Rules**

Swords & Wizardry: Whitebox is very easy to learn and play. The basic rules are simple and clear. As you create your character and read through the rules, you will see that there are several “Alternate Rules” described. These are for customizing the game to fit the way you want to play, but if you are the Referee and this is your first time running a game like this, stick with the basic rules and customize later. The alternate rules, plus any new rules that you and your group invent, are often called “House Rules,” because each gaming group will use a different mix of alternate and invented rules. This is a good thing – eventually you’re supposed to customize your game to fit what you want, not to follow the “official” rules forever and ever.

Don’t forget to check out the S&W website:

for more house rules. Feel free to submit your own!

[end sidebox]


**Character Sheets**

A character sheet is a piece of paper designed to organize and contain any and all necessary PC information, for the benefit of both the Referee and Player. For WHITEBOX, the character sheet could be something as simple as a 3x5” index card—with equipment and spells written on the back:

Larger and more detailed sheets can be found online at the S&W website. Feel free to create and share your own designs.

### **Attribute Scores**
The basic abilities are numbers which represent the Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Constitution, Dexterity, and Charisma of a character. The standard way to create attribute scores is to roll 3d6 for each attribute in the previously mentioned order. Once those rolls have been made, it is often obvious which type of character best fits the abilities—though, the player always has the option to play any class desired. Once the player decides on a class, points from other attributes may be shifted around, but only into the “Prime Attribute” of that character class (Prime Attributes are discussed later). Shifting points around may not lower another ability score below 9, however.

Some Referees allow more flexibility. One example is to let the players roll 3d6 a total of six times and arrange the rolls however they want. This allows the player to put the best results into abilities that best suit the type of character the player wants to be. There are several house rules that can be invented for this later on, if you choose.

### **[sidebox]**
### **Alternate Rule: Universal Attribute Bonus**

Swords & Wizardry: WhiteBox doesn’t give many bonuses for having high attribute scores. You can modify the game to increase the effect that these scores have. One quick way to do this is to use the table below whenever you need a quick rule. Feel free to tinker with the values, if you even decide to even use them at all! For example, if you prefer the “average” range to be 9–12, adjust the table accordingly.

**Universal Attribute Bonus Table**

#### Attribute Roll		Description		Bonus		
3-6			Below Average		-1 (or -5%)

7–14			Average			None

15–18			Above Average		+1 (or +5%)

Here are some examples of how the table can be used (and these are only *options*, not rules):

##### *Strength*
Fighters can use their Strength Bonus to modify their “to-hit” and damage results when using melee weapons.

##### *Intelligence*
Magic-users can use their Intelligence Bonus to improve “spell effectiveness” (i.e. target suffers a loss on his saving throw).

##### *Wisdom*
Clerics can use their Wisdom Bonus to improve “spell effectiveness” in the same way Magic-users use their Intelligence Bonus.

##### *Dexterity*
Dexterity can be used to modify a character’s Armor Class. This may be limited to more swashbuckling campaigns or in games where armor is more limited.

Be careful with this, though, unless you want to create super-hero characters!


[end sidebox]


**[sidebox]**

An *alternate method* for the experience point bonus is simply to give the character a bonus of 10% if the Prime Attribute is 15+, 5% if the Prime Attribute is 13-14, and –10% if the Prime Attribute is lower than 9. There is no bonus for scores between 9 and 12. If you use this method, do *not* also give the +5% bonuses described in the basic rules that follow: if you do it this way, the maximum XP bonus is 10%.

[end sidebox]

**Experience Bonus**

Each character gets a bonus percentage to their “experience points” (XP) that will increase the amount of experience points gained during an adventure. All characters add together the following: 5% if the character’s Prime Attribute is 15+, 5% if Wisdom is 15+, and 5% if Charisma is 15+.  A Cleric with Wisdom of 15+ gets the 5% bonus twice: once because it is the Prime Attribute for a Cleric, and again because it is applied to all characters. The maximum attainable bonus is 15%. All awards of XP to the character during play will be increased by the amount of the bonus (by 0%, 5%, 10%, or 15%, whichever it is).


### **Strength**
Strength represents the character’s physical power. It is the Prime Attribute for Fighters, so when a Fighter character has Strength of 15+, the character gets a 5% bonus to XP.

### **Intelligence**
Intelligence represents IQ, reasoning, and the ability to solve puzzles or understand difficult concepts. A high Intelligence score gives a character an additional language for every point above 10. Intelligence is the Prime Attribute for Magic-users, who will get a 5% bonus to XP if the character’s Intelligence is 15+.

### **Wisdom**
Wisdom determines a character’s insight, perception, and good judgment. Wisdom is the Prime Attribute for Clerics. Any character with a Wisdom score of 15+ gets a 5% bonus to XP, and a Cleric character with Wisdom 15+ gets another 5% (total of 10%) because it is the Prime Attribute for the Cleric class.

### **Constitution**
Constitution refers to the health and endurance of a character. A high Constitution score (15+) gives the character a +1 to each hit die, and a low score (6 or lower) gives a –1 penalty to each hit die.

### **Dexterity**
Dexterity is a combination of coordination and quickness. A high Dexterity score (15+) gives a character a bonus on “to-hit” rolls when attacking with a bow or other ranged weapon, and a low score (8 or less) gives a penalty of -1 to such rolls.

### **Charisma**
Charisma refers to a character’s leadership ability. Any character with a Charisma of 15+ receives a 5% bonus to XP.

Charisma also determines the number of Non-Player Character (NPC) hirelings a character can acquire. These hirelings include specialists (ship captains, assassins, etc.) and non-human creatures, but do not usually include basic men-at-arms. Charisma modifies the loyalty of these NPCs (See “Loyalty”).

### **Charisma Bonus Table**

|**Charisma**|**Hirelings (Max #)**|**Loyalty**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|3–4|1|-2|
|5–6|2|-2|
|7–8|3|-1|
|9–12|4|0|
|13–15|5|+1|
|16–17|6|+2|
|18|7|+2|

### **Hit Points**
Hit points (HP) represent the amount of “damage” a character can take before dying: they are determined by the number of hit dice (HD) the character has at each level, which is found in the description of each character class later on. If a player begins the game with a 1st level Fighter (1+1 HD) the player would therefore roll 1 HD (1d6) and add “+1” to the end result to determine his PC’s starting hit points. When the character accumulates enough XP to gain a level, usually a new hit die is rolled and added to the total (sometimes a new level only gives an additional hit point, though, not a whole new hit die).

Hit points are (optionally) re-rolled each time a Player Character gains a level. If the re-roll results in the character having fewer hit points for the new level than from the old level, the hit points remain the same.

### **Starting Gold**
Roll 3d6 and multiply the result by 10. This represents the number of gold pieces (gp) that a character possesses at the start of the campaign.

### **Alignment**
Alignments in the game are described as Law, Chaos, and Neutrality. In general, Law also corresponds to being “good,” Chaos corresponds to being “evil,” and Neutrality simply means that the character is indifferent between the two moral polarities. It is quite possible for the Referee to make the alignment system more complex: perhaps Lawful only means that you are in favor of centralized hierarchies in society, in which case you could actually be Lawful Evil as well as Lawful Good. It is a matter of preference if you want to make the alignment system more complex.
### **Character Retirement**
If a character reaches the highest level listed on the table for that character class, what happens? Does advancement stop? Does the character have to retire? Each group has its own play style and a preference for a given range of character levels for their games. If the Referee wants to extend the tables to allow higher-level characters, then go for it!
##
## **Chapter 2**
**Character Classes**

There are three character classes in the game: the Cleric, the Fighter, and the Magic-user. The Referee is, of course, free to invent or allow other character classes in the game.

###### **The Cleric**
Clerics are armored priests who serve a particular alignment, religion, or patron deity. Players may make up the details if the Referee doesn’t use a particular mythology for the campaign. Mythologies and other details of a campaign world often come later if the Referee is just starting.

Regardless of the details, the Cleric is a champion of his faith and/or moral alignment. The character might be a sinister witch-hunter, an exorcist of demons, a shining knight of the faith, or a secret agent of some temple hierarchy. Since many of the Cleric’s abilities are oriented toward healing and protecting, they tend to play a support role during combat. However, they are able to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the party’s Fighters if need be—at least for a while. Clerics must be either Lawful (good) or Chaotic (evil). There are no Neutral Clerics unless the Referee decides otherwise. Chaos, Law, and Neutrality are described further on.

### **Cleric Advancement Table**

|<h3>**Level**</h3>|**Exp. Points**|**Hit Dice (d6)**|**Saving Throw**|**Spells**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :-: |
|||||**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|
|1|0|1|15|–|–|–|–|–|
|2|1,500|2|14|1|–|–|–|–|
|3|3,000|3|13|2|–|–|–|–|
|4|6,000|3+1|12|2|1|–|–|–|
|5|12,000|4|11|2|2|1|–|–|
|6|24,000|5|10|2|2|1|1|–|
|7|48,000|6|9|2|2|2|1|1|

|9|192,000|7|7|3|3|3|2|2|
|10|384,000|8|6|3|3|3|3|3|

### **Cleric Class Abilities**
*Weapon and Armor Restrictions:* Because Clerics are forbidden the shedding of blood, they may only use blunt weapons (club, flail, mace, etc.) and the only missile weapon they are allowed is oil. Clerics have no armor restrictions.

*Spell Casting:* Clerics cast divine spells from a specific spell list, as per the Cleric Advancement table. Each day, the Cleric prays for a certain set of spells, choosing any spells from the standard list. Clerics of specific gods might have entirely different sets of spells as designed by the Referee, but the standard Cleric uses the standard spell list.

*Saving Throw:* Clerics receive a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. poison and paralysis (unless the alternative “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

*Banishing Undead:* Clerics can use their holiness to “Turn” the undead, causing them to flee (See Turning Undead, Page 22).

*Establish Temple:* At tenth level, a Cleric who chooses to build and dedicate a temple to a deity may attract a body of loyal followers who swear fealty to the character. If the Cleric changes alignment after establishing a Temple, the character will lose any followers (and probably face a mutiny).

*Experience Bonus for Wisdom:* Wisdom is the Prime Attribute for Clerics.  Clerics with Wisdom of 15 or higher receive a 10% to experience, 5% as normal, and 5% because it is the Prime Attribute for the class.


###### **The Fighter**

The Fighter is a warrior, trained in battle and in the use of armor and weapons. Your character might be a ferocious Viking raider, a roaming samurai, or a medieval knight. Because they are the best equipped of all the character classes to dish out and absorb damage, Fighters often end up on the front lines, going toe-to-toe with dragons, goblins, and evil cultists. If you are the party’s Fighter, the down-and-dirty work is up to you.

### **Fighter Advancement Table**

|**Level**|**Exp. Points**|**Hit Dice (d6)**|**Saving Throw**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|1|0|1+1|14|
|2|2,000|2|13|
|3|4,000|3|12|
|4|8,000|4|11|
|5|16,000|5|10|
|6|32,000|6|9|
|7|64,000|7|8|
|8|128,000|8|7|
|9|256,000|9|6|
|10|512,000|10|5|

### **Fighter Class Abilities**
Weapon and Armor Restrictions: Fighters are trained in warfare and, as such, have no restrictions on the kind of weapons or armor they can use.

*Combat Machine:* Against foes of one hit dice (HD) or fewer, Fighters get one attack per level each combat round.

*Saving Throw:* Fighters receive a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. death and poison (unless the alternative “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

*Establish Stronghold:* At ninth level, a Fighter who chooses to build a castle is considered to have reached the rank of “Baron” or “Baroness,” bestowed by the local ruler or monarch. The character may choose to attract a body of men-at-arms, who will swear their fealty as loyal followers.

*Experience Bonus for Strength:* Strength is the Prime Attribute for Fighters, which means that a Strength score of 15+ grants an additional 5% experience.
#######

######
###### **The Magic-User**

The Magic-user is a mysterious figure, a student of arcane powers and spell casting. They can be devastating opponents. However, at lower levels, they are quite vulnerable and must be protected by the other party members. As Magic-users progress, they generally become the most powerful of the character classes—holding sway over the political destinies of great kingdoms and able to create wondrous magical artifacts.

### **Magic-User Advancement Table**

|**Level**|**Exp. Points**|**Hit Dice (d6)**|**Saving Throw**|**Spells**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|||||**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**6**|

|15|–|8|2|5|5|5|4|4|4|
|16|–|8+1|2|5|5|5|5|5|5|

### **Magic-user Class Abilities**
Weapon and Armor Restrictions: Magic-users tend to spend their waking hours in study of arcane tomes and scrolls. As such, they have little time to train with weapons or learn how to properly engage in physical combat. Magic-users may only wield daggers or staves, and are not allowed the use of armor.

*Spell Casting:* Unlike the Cleric, the Magic-user owns a book of spells—which does not necessarily include all of the spells on the standard lists. Reading from this book, the Magic-user presses a select spell formula into his mind, effectively “preparing” it to be cast.  Once a prepared spell is cast, the spell formulae disappears from the Magic-user’s mind, and must be prepared again before another attempt can be made to cast it. However, it is possible to prepare a spell multiple times using the available “slots” in the Magic-user’s memory. If the Magic-user finds spell scrolls during an adventure, he can copy them into his spell book.

*Saving Throw:* Magic-users receive a +2 bonus on saving throws vs. spells—including those cast from wands and staves (unless the Alternate “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

*Experience Bonus for Intelligence:* Intelligence is the Prime Attribute for Magic-users, which means that an Intelligence score of 15+ grants them an additional 5% to all experience points awarded.

**Chapter 3**

**Character Races**

In a fantasy world, humans often aren’t alone. Elves may populate the great forests, Dwarves may carve their halls and mines into the heart of the earth, and Halflings may reside in the comfortable hill-houses of their bucolic shires. By contrast, some fantasy worlds depict an isolated human race pitted against ancient pre-human evils and the grim, savage wilderness of worlds at the dawn (or dusk) of human civilization itself. Some fantasy worlds, as a third example, accentuate the bizarre, with a wide variety of fantasy races available to the players—such worlds are filled with conflict and contradictions, always with a new wonder to be found beyond the next corner. The Referee determines what non-human races, if any, you can choose for your character.

###### **The Dwarf**

Dwarves tend to grow up in underground cities. As such, Dwarves easily take note of certain features of stonework: sloping corridors, moving walls, and traps made of stone (in particular: falling blocks, rigged ceilings, and tiny slits designed to release arrows, darts, or poison gas). There are no established rules or die roll for making use of these abilities; exactly what the Dwarf does or does not perceive is for the Referee to decide.

### **Dwarven Race Abilities**
*Character Advancement:* The only character class available to Dwarves is that of the Fighter, and they are typically allowed to advance only as high as 6th level.  

*Weapon and Armor Restrictions:* Like human Fighters, Dwarves have been trained in warfare and have no restrictions on the weapons or armor they may use.

*Fighting Giants:* Giants, ogres, and similar giant-type creatures such as trolls are not good at fighting dwarves, and only inflict half the normal damage against them.

*Keen Detection:* Dwarves are good at spotting traps, slanting passages, and construction while underground.

*Saving Throw:* Dwarves do not use magic and, as such, are somewhat immune to its effects; they receive a +4 bonus on saving throws vs. magic (whether or not the alternate “Saving Throw Matrix” is used). 

*Languages:* For campaigns that give each race its own dialect, Dwarves should be able to speak with gnomes, goblins, orcs, and kobolds.

######
###### **The Elf**

The Referee can interpret Elves in many different ways. Are they faerie-folk of Irish legend, the Vanir of Norse mythology, or perhaps something more akin to the Elves of Tolkien’s imagination? 

As a baseline, most Elves are associated with magic as well as being skilled with the sword and bow. The Elven adventurer may choose, on any given day—perhaps when the moon rises—whether to use the capabilities of the Fighter or Magic-user. As a result, the Elf has two alternate advancement paths (experience points, hit dice, saving throws, “to-hit” bonuses, etc.) depending upon whether he donned steel that day or summoned up the power to cast spells. 

Elves must use a spell book to prepare spells, just as a Magic-user. Spells disappear from his casting capability once they are cast, until prepared again.

### **Elven Race Abilities**
Character Advancement: Elves may use either the Fighter or Magic-user class advancement charts, to be announced at the start of an adventure. They are typically allowed to progress only to 4th level as Fighters and 8th as Magic-users.

*Weapon and Armor Restrictions:* When an Elf adventures as a Magic-user, the character has the same weapon and armor limitations as a Magic-user. The exception to this would be magic armor, which may still be worn even when the Elf is acting as a Magic-user.

*Hereditary Foes:* Elves gain an extra +1 (“to-hit” or to damage) when fighting goblins, orcs, intelligent undead, and lycanthropes. Elves are also immune to paralysis caused by undead such as ghouls.

*Keen Detection:* Elves are good at spotting hidden and concealed doors (1-4 on a d6 when searching, 1-2 on a d6 if just passing by).

*Languages:* For campaigns that give each race its own dialect, Elves should be able to speak with gnolls, goblins, orcs, and hobgoblins.

**The Elf (Variant)**

Some Referees may want to allow the Elf to advance as a blend of Fighter and Magic-user instead of switching back and forth. In that model, the following advancement table might be used instead. Aside from Character Advancement and Weapon and Armor Restrictions, Elven Race Abilities remain the same.

### **Elf (Variant) Advancement Table**

|**Level**|**Exp. Points**|**Hit Dice (d6)**|**Saving Throw**|**Spells**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|||||**1**|**2**|**3**|
|1|0|1+1|14|–|–|–|
|2|5,000|2|13|1|–|–|
|3|10,000|2+1|12|2|–|–|
|4|20,000|3|11|2|1|–|
|5|40,000|3+1|10|3|2|–|
|6|80,000|4|9|4|2|–|
|7|160,000|4+1|8|4|2|1|
|8|320,000|5|7|4|2|2|

**Elven Race Abilities (Variant)**

Weapon and Armor Restrictions: Elves would have the advantage of both magic and armor at the same time, so the Referee may limit the Elf to chain mail. Elves may not use two-handed weapons (two-handed sword, polearms, etc.) or shields while casting spells.

**The Halfling**

Halflings are short, often stout, and live in shires, rustic communities that are usually remote from those of larger folk. A few of them have a mildly adventurous spirit, enough to venture forth for a while at least, exploring the world beyond the farms and fields of the local shire.

### **Halfling Race Abilities**
*Character Advancement:* The only character class available to Halflings is that of the Fighter, and they are typically allowed to advance only as high as 4th level.  

*Weapon and Armor Restrictions:* Like human Fighters, the Halfling has no weapon or armor restrictions.

*Fighting Giants:* Giants, ogres, and similar giant-type creatures such as trolls are not good at fighting small creatures such as halflings and dwarves, and only inflict half the normal damage against them.

*Deadly Accuracy with Missiles:* Halflings receive a +2 “to-hit” when firing missile weapons in combat.

*Near Invisibility:* When not engaged in combat, Halflings can be quite stealthy, making themselves hard to spot and moving in almost total silence.

*Saving Throw:* Halflings are somewhat immune to magic, and receive +4 on saving throws vs. magic (even if the “Saving Throw Matrix” is used).

*Languages:* For campaigns that give each race its own dialect, Halflings should be able to speak with creatures that fit the style of the Referee’s campaign.

**Chapter 4**

**Items and Equipment**

Each character starts with some gold pieces (3d6x10) at the beginning of the game, used to buy equipment. One gold piece (gp) is worth 10 silver pieces (sp) or 100 copper pieces (cp). Prices for equipment are listed on the tables below in amount of gold pieces. The Referee is encouraged to include additional items and equipment.

### **Equipment Weight**
A “normal” level of miscellaneous equipment is assumed to weigh 10 pounds. If treasure is added to this, each coin and gem is assumed to weigh 0.1 pound.

### **Adventuring Gear**

In the Original Game, all weapons did 1d6 damage, regardless of type. Swords & Wizardry WhiteBox provides some slight variation. To play the Original Game as it was written, simply ignore all variations in weapon damage – they all inflict 1d6 damage regardless of whether the weapon is a two-handed sword or a dagger.

\* At the Referee’s discretion, magical armor weighs either half of its normal weight or nothing at all

[sidebox]

**Important**

The Referee must decide which of the two armor class systems to use. In the “Descending” armor class system, a lower AC means you are harder to hit. In the “Ascending” armor class system, it is a higher armor class that is harder to hit.

Numbers for the “Ascending” armor class system always appear in brackets [like this].

[End sidebox]

### **Calculating Armor Class**
To calculate a character’s Armor Class, you must decide which system to use. The two systems have the same numbers, but in one of them a high armor class is better, and in one a low armor class is worse. Just decide which you prefer:

### **Descending AC System**
In this system, an unarmored human has an AC of 9. The armor you buy lowers your AC and the lower the AC, the harder you are to hit. To calculate your Armor Class, look at the Armor table above, in the “Effect on…” column. For whatever type of armor you bought, subtract the number shown from your base AC of 9. That’s your new Armor Class.

### **Ascending AC System**
For the ascending system, an unarmored person has an AAC of [10]. AAC means “ascending armor class,” and it is used in brackets as a reminder of which system is in use. Your armor adds to your AAC, so the higher your AAC, the harder it is for your

enemies to hit you. To calculate your Ascending Armor Class, look at the Armor table on the previous page, in the “Effect on…” column. For whatever type of armor you bought, add the number shown in brackets to your base AAC of [10]. That’s your new Armor Class.

### **Converting Armor Class Systems**
To translate between the Ascending and Descending AC systems, the ascending armor class (AAC) and descending armor class (AC) values should add up to 19. Thus, AC 7 is the same as AAC [12] (19-7=12).

### **Hiring Assistants**
Many characters, particularly when first starting an adventuring career, are in need of hirelings to assist in carrying loot or fighting monsters. Characters are free to create advertisements and inquire at local establishments to find available hirelings. The table below assumes that a typical adventure lasts roughly one week. Prices are in gold pieces.

### **Hiring Assistants**

|**Hireling Type**|**Cost**|
| :- | :-: |
|Alchemist|250|
|Animal Trainer|125|
|Armorer|25|
|Assassin|500|
|Blacksmith|5|
|Captain, Ship|75|
|Engineer|200|
|Horseman|3|
|Non-combatant (servant, torch bearer)|2|
|Sage|500|
|Sailor|3|
|Soldier|5|
|Spy|125|

These rates are for humans only. Demi-humans cost more to hire—and it may take more than just the promise of gold coins.

**Chapter 5**

**Playing the Game**

Once characters have been created, the Referee will describe where the characters are and what they can see. The game might start in a rural peasant village, a vast and teeming city spiked with towers and minarets, a castle, a tavern, or at the gates of an ancient tomb. From that point on, Players describe what their characters do. Going down stairs, attacking a dragon, talking to other Player Characters (PCs) or Non-Player Characters (NPCs) controlled by the Referee —all of these kinds of actions are decided by the players. The Referee then describes what happens as a result:  the stairs lead down to a huge tomb, the dragon attacks the characters, etc. The rules below are guidelines handling events like combat, gaining experience, movement, healing, dying, and other important parts of the game.

Basically, you and the Referee work together, with the Referee handling the details of a dangerous fantasy world, and you handling what your character does in it. The epic story of your character’s rise to greatness (or death in the effort) is yours to create in the Referee’s world.

### **Gaining Experience**
Characters are awarded Experience Points (XP) for killing monsters and accumulating treasure. Monsters have set Experience Point values in their descriptions, and one gold piece acquired is equal to one XP. Experience is awarded for accumulating treasure because every gold piece gained by a character is an index of his player’s skill. Awarding experience only for killing monsters fails to reward a party of adventurers that successfully lures a dragon away from its hoard so that its treasure can be stolen without a fight— it fails to reward characters that operate by intelligence, stealth, trickery, and misdirection.

Each character class has a Prime Attribute listed in its description, and the character creation process details how to determine the character’s total XP bonus. There are two different ways of doing it, but each one results in a percent bonus. If a character’s bonus is 10%, for example, and the Referee awards 1000xp to each character, that particular character would get 1100xp (10% of 1000 is 100, so the character gets a bonus of 100xp).

### **Time**
The Referee will be required to make general rulings on the passage of time during the course of a campaign (e.g. “A few hours later...”) and should be governed by common sense. There are, however, two important time measurements that merit brief definitions--the “turn” and “combat round.” A turn (lasting ten minutes) is used to track and measure actions, movement and resources when our intrepid adventurers are in dangerous places. The shorter combat round (lasting one minute) is used in the midst of battle to allow for a faster blow-by-blow account of the action.

### **Movement**
Base movement rate for all races is calculated on the table below in tens of feet per turn, allowing for two moves per turn.

### **Movement Rate**

|**Weight Carried (lb.)**|**Elf/Human**|**Dwarf/Halfling**|

######### **Combat**

When the party of adventurers comes into contact with enemies, the order of events in the combat round is as follows: 

\1) The Referee determines if one side or the other is entitled to a free attack or move as a result of surprise—this is either a judgement or a die roll of some kind, depending on the circumstances. Normally, anyone is surprised if they roll a 1 or a 2 on a d6.

\2) Determine initiative. One roll is made for each side, not for each individual in combat.

- Party with initiative acts first (missile fire, casting spells, movement, melee attacks, etc.) and results take effect.
- Party that lost initiative acts; results take effect.
- The round is complete; keep turn order for the next round if the battle has not been resolved.

[sidebar]
### **Intent**
Some Referees prefer to have all parties make a “statement of intent” before they roll initiative in order to force players to decide what they’re doing before they know who goes first. 

[end sidebar]

**How Initiative Works**

At the beginning of the first combat round, each side rolls initiative on a d6—high roll wins. The winning side acts first, casting spells, moving, and attacking. The other side takes damage and casualties, and then has its turn.

Initiative rolls may result in a tie. When this happens, both sides are considered to be acting simultaneously. The Referee may handle this situation in any way he chooses—with one caveat. The damage inflicted by the combatants during any simultaneous initiative is inflicted even if one of the combatants dies during the round. It is possible for two combatants to kill each other in this situation. If you want to play things more simply, just re-roll initiative if there is a tie until one side or the other wins the initiative.

########
######## **Alternate Combat Sequence**

The sequence of battle is one of the most commonly house-ruled parts of the game. Here is one possibility, also based on the Original Game:

\1) **Roll for surprise.** Anyone not surprised gets a free round of combat in the normal order (see below). If neither side, or both sides, are surprised, move on to the next step.

\2) **Roll for initiative** (one roll for each whole side), and follow the sequence described: 

First, any “prepared” spells are cast. It takes a full combat round to prepare a spell, but one can be prepared ahead of time. Spellcasters who won the initiative cast their spells first. They may then start preparing a spell for the next round, if desired.

Next, missile weapons are fired (if the bow was already in the character’s hands and ready to go). This also happens in order of initiative. 

Then melee combat takes place, in order of initiative. Finally, movement takes place, in order of initiative.

If it is important to find out which character in the party goes before another one, just compare their Dexterity scores to see which is higher.
###
### **The Attack Roll**
The most important rule to understand about combat is the attack roll.

To attack with a weapon, the player rolls a d20 and adds any bonuses to the result. These “to-hit” bonuses may include a strength bonus (for attacks with hand held weapons), a dexterity bonus (for attacks with missile weapons), and any bonuses for magic weapons. The player then subtracts any “to-hit” penalties they might have from their roll.

The attack roll is then compared to a table to see if the attack hits. If the attack roll is equal to or higher than the number on the table, the attack hits. If you are using the Ascending AC system, rather than refer to these tables, there is a quick formula presented at the end of this chapter that you can use (See Ascending AC Combat, Page 23). The Referee decides which will be used.

If an attack hits, it inflicts damage (as determined by the weapon’s damage die). The damage is subtracted from the defender’s hit point total (See “Damage and Death”).

###### **Specific Situations**
The following are a compilation of guidelines and instructions for handling certain, specific situations that might arise during combat.

### **Damage and Death**
When a character (or creature) is hit, the amount of damage taken is deducted from his hit points. When hit points reach 0, the character dies.

**A Less Harsh Method**

Referees have different ideas concerning how lethal a game should be. For this reason, many allow characters to become “unconscious” at 0 HP, with death staved off until the character reaches some predetermined negative number.

For example, many Referees employ a house rule which allows a character’s HP to fall below 0 by as many points as their level before the character dies; a 4th level character might die only if he falls below -4 HP. Generally, though, a character with fewer than 0 HP is considered to be bleeding to death at 1 HP per round until the wounds are bound up.

### **Healing**
In addition to the various magical means of restoring HP, a character will recover 1 full Hit point per day of uninterrupted rest. Four weeks of rest will restore all of a character’s HP—regardless of how many the character lost.

### **Binding Wounds**
Referees can allow characters to bind 1d4 HP worth of wounds following a battle. This is of particular use in low-magic campaigns or in adventures where none of the Players has chosen to run a Cleric.

Note that the character can only recover HP lost during this particular battle. Recovered HP cannot cause a character to have more hit points than normal. 

### **Invisible Opponents**
An invisible opponent can only be attacked if its general location is known, and the attack suffers a -4 penalty “to-hit.” Note that more powerful monsters (those with sensitive smell, hearing, or those with more than 6 HD) will frequently be able to detect invisible opponents; the Referee should determine the chance of this based on the creature and the situation.

### **Melee Attack**
A melee attack is an attack with a hand-held weapon such as a sword, spear, or dagger. Two combatants within ten feet of each other are considered to be “in melee.”

### **Missile Attack**
Missile attacks are attacks with ranged weapons such as crossbows, slings, or thrown axes. When using missiles to fire into melee, it is not possible to choose which opponent (or friend!) will receive the brunt of the attack.

### **Morale**
Certain monsters, such as mindless or undead creatures, are fearless and will always fight to the death. The majority, however, will not continue to fight a hopeless battle and will seek to retreat, surrender, or flee. The Referee will decide when monsters abandon battle and retreat, based upon the situation and the monster’s intelligence. Referees should also use morale to determine the actions and loyalty of hirelings or other companion NPCs.

### **Negotiation and Diplomacy**
Some combats can be averted with a few well chosen words (even lies). If the party is outmatched, or the monsters don’t seem likely to be carrying much in the way of loot, the party might elect to brazen their way through in an attempt to avoid combat or at least delay it until more favorable conditions arise.

### **Spells**
Spell casting begins at the start of the combat round. It is possible to prepare a spell while within melee range of an opponent (10 feet) but if the caster suffers damage while preparing a spell, the spell is lost. Unless stated otherwise, the spell is cast (takes effect) in the caster’s initiative phase. Note that in the Alternative Sequence of Combat (described above), spell casting works differently. In that system, it takes a full round to *prepare* a spell, the spell is *cast* at the beginning of the round before anything else happens, and the caster may spend the rest of the round preparing a new spell (or doing something else such as moving or even fighting).

### **Loyalty**
The Referee may wish to make “loyalty checks” for NPCs put into dangerous situations or ones offered bribes to change sides during a conflict. When a loyalty check is made, roll 3d6 and consult the Loyalty table for the result. Remember that these checks can be modified by a Player’s Charisma score.

### **Loyalty Table**

|**Roll (3d6)**|<h3>**Loyalty**</h3>|
| :-: | :-: |
|3|Traitor|
|4–5|-2 on next loyalty check|
|6–8|-1 on next loyalty check|
|9–12|Average|
|13–15|+1 on next loyalty check|
|16–17|+2 on next loyalty check|
|18|Loyalist|

Good treatment, respect, and a fair share of treasure earned should garner bonuses to loyalty checks, while abuse, physical or otherwise, will bring about penalties, abandonment, or worse. NPCs should be treated as distinct individuals, and not mere extensions of the Player Character.

###
### **Saving Throws**
From time to time, a spell or some other kind of hazard requires you to make a "saving throw." A successful saving throw means that the character avoids a threat or lessens its effect. Each character class has a saving throw target number which gets lower and lower as the character gains levels. To make a saving throw, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or greater than the character's saving throw target number, the saving throw is successful. Monsters can also make saving throws (their saving throw target number is their HD subtracted from 19).

[Sidebox]

**Alternate Rule: The Saving Throw Matrix**

The *Swords & Wizardry* saving throw system is an adaptation of the original, which had several categories of different risks instead of a single basic saving throw as used here. The original version had the following categories and target numbers:

**Saving Throw Categories (Alternate Method)**

||**Death Rays and Poison**|**Wands (all)**|**Turned to Stone**|**Dragon’s Breath**|**Spells and Staffs**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

This table does not integrate directly into *Swords & Wizardry*: if you were to house-rule it in, you would have to eliminate the *Swords & Wizardry* class bonuses on saving throws (i.e., the bonuses listed for each class in the class description but *not* racial bonuses for non-humans).

### **Turning the Undead**
Lawful clerics (only) have the ability to “turn” the undead, causing them to flee or destroying them outright. When a turning attempt is made, roll 3d6 and consult the Turning Undead table (see below) for the result.

If the result on the dice is equal to or greater than the number shown on the table, all undead creatures of the targeted type are turned and will flee for 3d6 rounds (or cower helplessly if they are unable to flee).

For Lawfully aligned Clerics, if the table indicates a “D” then the undead creature is destroyed automatically and will crumble to dust.

**Turn Undead (Variant)**

Referees who wish to limit the use of the Turn Undead ability might try to count this as merely a 1st level Cleric spell.

[sidebox]

**Chaotic Clerics and the Undead**

Many Referees allow Chaotic clerics as well as Lawful clerics to turn the Undead. If Chaotic clerics are allowed to turn the undead, treat a result of “D” on the table a bit differently; instead of destroying the undead creature, the Chaotic cleric has forced it into servitude. It will follow the character’s commands, although the Referee will decide the limitations on this power. Perhaps the cleric can only keep a certain number of undead under control at one time (or a certain number of hit dice) – the cleric’s level is a good number to use for this limit, whether it stands for a maximum number of Undead creatures or for a maximum number of total hit dice.

**Ascending AC Combat – Quick Method**

If you’re using the Ascending AC system, it may be easier to calculate your “to-hit” rolls according to a simple formula. The numbers are the same as the Descending AC tables—this is just a different way of calculating the results. Here’s how it’s done:

To attack with a weapon, the player rolls a d20 and adds any bonuses to the result. These “to-hit” bonuses now include the character’s Base “to-hit” Bonus, as shown on the table below, and may include a strength bonus (for attacks with handheld weapons), a dexterity bonus (for attacks with missile weapons), and any bonuses for magic weapons. The player then subtracts any “to-hit” penalties they might have from their roll. If the result is equal to or greater than the opponent’s Ascending AC, the attack hits.

**Ascending AC Combat Table (Quick Method)**

||**Level**|
| :- | :-: |
||**1**|**2**|**3**|**4**|**5**|**6**|**7**|**8**|**9**|**10**|**11**|**12**|**13**|**14**|**15**|**16**|
|**Class**|**Base “to hit” Bonus**|
|Cleric|0|0|0|1|1|2|2|3|4|5|–|–|–|–|–|–|
|Fighter|0|1|2|2|3|4|4|5|6|6|–|–|–|–|–|–|
|Magic-user|0|0|0|0|1|1|2|2|3|3|4|4|5|5|6|6|

Note: This quick system *only works for the ascending AC system*.

In order to use this system, you’ll need to write down your Base “to-hit” Bonus, and adjust it as you gain levels, but after doing that, you won’t have to check the table to see if you score a hit. All you need to know is whether the total result was equal to or higher than the target’s armor class.

### **Gameplay Example**

*A Fighter, Arnold the Lion, is fighting three goblins in a dark alley of the Glittering City of Semoulia. We eavesdrop just as the encounter begins:*

Arnold’s player: “I draw myself up to full height and inform them that I’m a captain of the guard. My soldiers are right behind me, and these vermin better disperse or I’ll have them brought in for interrogation.”

Referee: “Um, no. They’re not buying it. You’re covered in filth from that garbage pit.”

Arnold’s player: “Oh, yeah. I forgot that.”

Referee: “Roll initiative.” (Secretly rolls a d6 and gets a result of 6.)

Arnold’s player: “I rolled a 2.”

Referee: “The goblins attack first. They’re all more than ten feet from you, and they move forward with their clubs at the ready.”

Arnold’s player: “They don’t charge?”

Referee: “Nope.”

Arnold’s player: “They don’t get an attack because they closed in. It’s my turn to attack, right?”

Referee: “Yes.”

Arnold’s player: (Rolls a d20.) “16—sweet! Adding my base to-hit bonus and Strength bonus gives me a total ‘to-hit’ roll of 18!”

Referee: (Notes that goblins have an Armor Class of 14, using the ascending AC rules.) “You swing your sword into the leading goblin. Roll for damage.”

Arnold’s player: (Rolls a d6.) “2 points, but I’ve got a +1 damage bonus, so that’s a total of 3 damage.”

Referee: (That’s enough to kill it. The goblin had only 2 hit points.) “Okay, so as it’s moving forward, the goblin slips a little bit in a puddle on the stones of the narrow alley where you’re fighting, and skids right onto your sword. As you yank out the blade, the goblin falls dead to the ground. The other two are still attacking, but they look nervous now—obviously starting to reconsider this whole thing.”

###
### **REMEMBER**

SWORDS & WIZARDRY is a free-form roleplaying game, meaning that there aren’t very many rules. The Referee is responsible for handling situations that aren’t covered by the rules, making fair evaluations of what the characters do and deciding what happens as a result. This is not a game in which the players are “against” the Referee, even though the Referee is responsible for creating tricky traps, dangerous situations, and running the monsters and other foes the PCs will encounter during the game. In fact, the players and the Referee cooperate with each other to create a fantasy epic, with the Referee creating the setting and the players developing the story of the heroes. If they aren’t skillful and smart, the epic might be very short. But it’s not the Referee’s job to defeat the players—it’s his job to provide interesting (and dangerous) challenges, and then guide the story fairly.



**Chapter 6**

**Spells and Magic**

Clerics and Magic-Users can cast spells, Fighters cannot. Spells have three phases. First they are *memorized* (a character can only memorize a certain number of spells to bring along on an adventure – see the description of the character classes to find out how many, and what level). Second, they are *prepared*, which is the process of saying the magic words and making the magic gestures. Third, the spell is *cast*, which means it takes effect and the magic happens. In the normal sequence of combat, the caster starts preparing at the beginning of the round and casts the spell whenever his/her side has the initiative. In the alternative combat sequence, it takes a whole round to prepare a spell, but spells are cast at the *beginning* of the next round, and the caster can then take other actions during the round, including preparing a spell for the next round.

Duration: 1 hour

1. As a Curse spell, the recipient is cursed with a -1 penalty to all attack rolls and, if the target is not a Player Character, suffers a decrease to morale.

### **Charm Monster**
Spell Level: M4

### **Cloudkill**
Spell Level: M5

Range: Close

Duration: 1 hour

Foul and poisonous vapors boil from the thin air, forming a cloud 15 feet in radius. The cloud moves away from the caster at a rate of 6 feet per minute unless its direction or speed is affected by winds. Unusually strong gusts can dissipate and destroy it. Poison-laden, the horrid mist is heavier than air, and thus sinks down any pits or stairs in its path. This spell affects only creatures with 5 or fewer HD.

### **Commune**
Spell Level: C5

Range: Caster

Duration: 3 questions

Higher powers grant answers to three questions the caster poses. Higher powers don’t like being constantly interrogated by mere mortals, so the spell should be limited to one casting per week or so. The Referee may rule that a caster may cast a double strength Commune spell composed of six questions once per year.

### **Confusion**
Spell Level: M4

Range: 120 ft.

Duration: 2 hours

This spell confuses people and monsters, making them act randomly. The effects of the confusion may shift every 10 minutes or so, and the dice are rolled again to determine any change. Roll 2d6 to determine the creature’s behavior:

### ` `**Confusion Reaction Table**

|**Roll**|**Reaction**|
| :-: | :-: |
|2–5|Attack the caster (and his allies)|
|6–8|Stand baffled and inactive|
|9–12|Attack each other|

The spell affects 2d6 creatures, plus an additional creature for every caster level above 8th. Creatures of 3 HD or fewer are automatically affected by the spell, and it takes effect immediately. Creatures of 4 HD or more automatically resist the confusion effect until it reaches its full power, which takes a number of minutes equal to 1d12 minus the caster’s level. These creatures must make a saving throw when the effect reaches full power and every 10 minutes thereafter or become confused for the remainder of the spell’s duration.

### **Conjure Elemental**
Spell Level: M5

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: Until dispelled

### **Contact Other Plane**
Spell Level: M5

Range: None

Duration: See table

The caster creates a mental contact with the planes, forces, powers, and geometries of the beyond, in order to gain affirmative or negative answers to the questions he contemplates. The spell’s effect depends on how deeply the caster wishes to delve into the planes of existence.

|5|1–10|11–18|19–20|

\* Planes are the “depth” at which the caster chooses to seek the truth; number of Yes/No questions asked

† Temporary insanity lasts for as many weeks equal to the depth of the plane where the caster’s sanity failed

‡ This represents the possibility of being mislead or misinterpreting an answer

### **Control Weather**

Duration: 1 hour (C), 20 min. (M)

1. As a Detect Chaos spell, the caster detects creatures of Chaos, or those with chaotic enchantments, intentions, thoughts, or auras within the spell’s range. Poison is not inherently evil or chaotic and cannot be detected by means of this spell.
1. As a Detect Law spell, the spell works exactly like Detect Chaos except that it detects Law.

### **Detect Invisibility**
Spell Level: M2

Range: 10 ft./caster level

Duration: 1 hour

Caster can perceive invisible creatures and objects.

### **Detect Magic**
Spell Level: C1, M1

Range: 60 ft.

Duration: 20 min.

The caster can perceive in places, people, or things the presence of a magical spell or enchantment. Magical items or secretly placed charms may be discovered with this spell.

Spell Level: M4

Range: 10 ft. casting, 360 ft. teleport

Duration: Instantaneous

Dimensional Portal is a weak form of the Teleport spell that can be managed by lesser magicians. The caster can teleport himself, an object, or another person with perfect accuracy to the stated location, as long as it is within the spell’s given range.

### **Disintegrate**
Spell Level: M6

Range: 60 ft.

Duration: Permanent

The caster defines one specific target such as a door, a peasant, or a statue, and it disintegrates into dust. Magical materials are not disintegrated, and living creatures (such as the aforementioned peasant) are permitted a saving throw. The Disintegrate spell cannot be dispelled.

**Dispel Chaos (Law)**

Spell Level: C5

Range: 30 ft.

Duration: 10 min.

1. As a Dispel Chaos spell, the spell is similar to the arcane spell Dispel Magic, but works against items, spells, or agents of Chaos. However, unlike Dispel Magic, this spell also functions against chaotic sendings, possibly including dreams or supernatural hunting-beasts.
1. As a Dispel Law spell, the spell works exactly like Dispel Chaos, except that it will dispel Law.

### **Dispel Magic**
Spell Level: M3

Range: 120 ft.

Duration: 10 min.

Dispel magic can be used to completely dispel most spells and enchantments.

As an example of how one might referee this spell, the chance of dispelling magic could be a percentage based on the ratio of the level of the caster trying to dispel over the level of the caster (or HD of the monster) who hurled the original magic.

Thus, a 6th level Magic-user attempting to dispel a charm cast by a 12th level Magic-user has a 50% chance of success (6 / 12 = 1/2). If the 12th level Magic-user were dispelling the 6th level Magic-user’s charm, the dispelling caster’s chance of success would be 200% (12 ∕ 6 = 2).

### **Feeblemind**
Spell Level: M5

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: Permanent until dispelled

Feeblemind is a spell that affects only Magic-users. The saving throw against the spell is made at a -4 penalty, and if the saving throw fails, the targeted Magic-user becomes feebleminded until the magic is dispelled.

### **Find Traps**
Spell Level: C2

Range: 30 ft.

Duration: 20 min.

Find Traps can allow the caster to perceive both magical and non-magical traps at a distance of 30 feet.

### **Fireball**
Spell Level: M3

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: Instantaneous

A missile shoots from the caster’s finger to explode at the targeted location in a furnace-like blast of fire. It has a burst radius of 20 feet and damage is 1d6 per level of the caster. The blast shapes itself to the available volume. A successful saving throw means that the target only takes half damage.

### **Fly**
Spell Level: M3

Range: Touch

Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn/level

This spell grants the power of flight, with a movement rate of 120 feet per round. The Referee rolls for the duration of the spell in secret and does not disclose this information to the Player.

### **Hallucinatory Terrain**
Spell Level: M4

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: Until touched by an enemy or dispelled

This spell changes the appearance of the terrain into the semblance of what the caster desires. A hill can be made to disappear, or could be replaced with an illusory forest, for example.

### **Hold Monster**
Spell Level: M5

Range: 120 ft.

Duration: 1 hour + 10 min./level

The caster can target either 1d4 creatures (saving throw applies) or may instead target a single creature who must make their save at a -2 penalty.

### **Hold Person** 
Spell Level: C2, M3

Duration: 90 min. (C), 1 hour + 10 min./level (M)

The caster can target either 1d4 persons (with the same parameters as Charm Person; saving throw applies) or may instead target a single creature who must make their save at a -2 penalty.

### **Hold Portal**
Spell Level: M1

Range: Referee’s discretion

Duration: 2d6 turns

This spell magically holds a door or gate in position for the spell’s duration (or until dispelled). Creatures with magic resistance can shatter the spell without much effort.

### **Insect Plague**
Spell Level: C5

Range: 480 ft.

Duration: 1 day

This spell only works outdoors. A storm of insects gathers, and goes wherever the caster directs. The cloud is approximately 400 square feet (20 × 20 feet, with roughly corresponding height). Any creature with fewer than 2 HD exposed to the cloud of insects will flee in terror (no saving throw).

### **Invisibility**
Spell Level: M2

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: Until dispelled or an attack is made

The object of this spell, whether a person or a thing, becomes invisible to both normal vision and to darkvision. If the Referee is using the invisibility rules unchanged, the result is that an invisible creature cannot be attacked unless its approximate location is known, and all attacks are made at -4 to-hit.

### **Invisibility, 10 ft. radius**
Spell Level: M3

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: Until dispelled or an attack is made

Identical to the Invisibility spell, which makes the target creature or object invisible to normal vision and to dark vision, except that it also throws a sphere of invisibility (with a 10 foot radius) around the recipient, which moves along with the target.

### **Invisible Stalker**
Spell Level: M6

Range: Near Caster

Duration: Until mission is completed

This spell summons an Invisible Stalker with 8 HD. The stalker will perform one task as commanded by the caster, regardless of how long the task may take or how far the stalker may have to travel. The stalker cannot be banished by means of Dispel Magic; it must be killed in order to deter it from its mission.

### **Knock**
Spell Level: M2

Range: 60 ft.

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell unlocks and unbars all doors, gates, and portals within its range, including those held or locked by normal magic.

### **Levitate**
Spell Level: M2

Range: 20 ft./level

Duration: 10 min./level

This spell allows the Magic-user to levitate himself, moving vertically up or down, but the spell itself provides no assistance with lateral movement. A wall, cliff side, or ceiling could be used to move along hand-over-hand. 

Levitation allows up or downward movement at a rate of up to 6 feet per minute (60 feet per turn), and the caster cannot levitate more than 20 feet per level from the ground level where the spell was cast (such range being applied both to movement into the air and to downward movement into a pit or chasm).

**Light (Dark)**

Spell Level: C1, M1

Range: 120 ft.

###
### **Lightning Bolt**
Spell Level: M3

Range: 60 ft.

Duration: Instantaneous

A nearly ten foot wide bolt of lightning extends 60 feet from the fingertip of the caster. Anyone in its path suffers 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, though a successful saving throw halves damage. The bolt always extends 60 feet, even if this means that it ricochets backward from something that blocks its path.

###
### **Locate Object**
Spell Level: C3, M2

Range: 90 ft. (C), 60 ft. + 10 ft./level (M)

Duration: 1 min./level

This spell gives the caster the correct direction (as the crow flies) toward an object the caster specifies with a description. The object cannot be something the caster has never seen, although the spell can detect an object in a general class of items known to the caster: stairs, gold, etc.


### **Magic Jar**
Spell Level: M5

Range: See below

Duration: See below

This spell relocates the caster’s life essence, intelligence, and soul into an object (of virtually any kind). The “jar” must be within 30 feet of the caster’s body for the transition to succeed. 

Once within the magic jar, the caster can possess the bodies of other creatures and people, provided that they are within 120 feet of the jar and fail a saving throw. The caster can return his soul to the magic jar at any time, and if a body he controls is slain, his life essence returns immediately to the jar. If the caster’s body is destroyed while his soul is in the magic jar, the soul no longer has a home other than within the magic jar (although the disembodied wizard can still possess other bodies as before). If the jar itself is destroyed while the Magic-user’s soul is within, the soul is lost. The Magic-user can return from the jar to his own body whenever desired, thus ending the spell.

### **Massmorph**
Spell Level: M4

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: Until negated or dispelled

One hundred or fewer man-sized creatures are changed to appear like innocent trees. The illusion is so perfect that creatures moving through the “forest” will not detect the deception.

### **Move Earth**
Spell Level: M6

Range: 240 ft.

### **Move Water**
Spell Level: M6

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: See below

The caster must announce which of the two options are being cast:

1. The spell lowers the depth and water level of lakes, rivers, wells, and other bodies of water to 1/2 their normal levels. Used this way, the spell lasts for 10 turns.
1. Alternately, this spell creates a gap through water, but only to a depth of 10 feet. Used this way, the spell lasts for 6 turns.

### **Neutralize Poison**
Spell Level: C4

Range: Referee’s discretion

### **Phantasmal Force**
Spell Level: M2

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: Until negated or dispelled

Duration: Permanent until dispelled

Up to 300 square feet of ground can be affected by this spell; undergrowth in the area suddenly grows into an impassable forest of thorns and vines. The caster can decide the shape of the area to be enchanted. An alternate version (Referee’s decision) would allow the spell to affect an area of 300 × 300 feet, for a total of 90,000 square feet.

### **Polymorph**
Spell Level: M4

Range: See below

Duration: See below

The caster must announce which of the two options are being cast:

1. The caster assumes the form of any object or creature, gaining the new form’s attributes (the use of wings, for example), but not its hit points or combat abilities. The Referee might allow the benefit of the new form’s armor class, if it is due to heavily armored skin. A great deal of the spell’s effect is left to the Referee to decide. This form of the spell lasts for roughly one hour plus one additional hour for each level of the caster.
1. Alternately, this spell allows the caster to turn another being into a different type of creature (such as a dragon, a garden slug, and of course, a frog or newt). The polymorphed creature gains all the abilities of the new form, but retains its own mind and hit points. Used in this way, the range on this spell is 60 feet. This form of the spell lasts until dispelled.

### **Project Image**
Spell Level: M6

1. As a Protection from Law spell, it does the same thing except that lawful creatures suffer the -1 penalty.

### **Protection from Chaos (Law), 10 ft. radius**

Range: 10 ft. radius around caster

Raise Dead allows the Cleric to raise a corpse from the dead, provided it has not been dead too long. The normal time limit is 4 days, but for every caster level higher than 8th, the time limit extends another 4 days. Characters with low constitution might not survive the ordeal; and even for those with a strong constitution, a period of two weeks is required before they can function normally. This spell only functions on races that can be used for Player Characters (i.e., “human-like”).

### **Read Languages**
Spell Level: M1

Spell Level: M5

Range: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous

This spell transports the caster or another person to a destination that the caster knows (at least knowing what it looks like from a painting or a map). Success depends on how well the caster knows the targeted location:

1. If the caster has only indirect experience of the destination (known only through a picture or map) there is a 25% chance of success—with failure resulting in death.
1. If the caster has seen but not studied the destination there is an 20% chance of failure. Half of failures will place the traveler 1d10 × 10 feet below the intended location, possibly resulting in death from arrival within a solid substance. The other half of failures will place the traveler 1d10 × 10 feet above the targeted location, possibly resulting in a deadly fall. 
1. If the caster is familiar with the location or has studied it carefully there is a 5% chance of failure, with 1 in 6 failures arriving below and 5 in 6 arriving above the targeted location. In either case, the arrival is 1d4 × 10 feet low or high.

### **Wall of Fire or Ice**
Spell Level: M4

Range: 60 ft.

Duration: Concentration

The caster must announce which of the two options are being cast:

1. As a Wall of Fire spell, the caster conjures a wall of fire that flares into being and burns for as long as the caster concentrates upon it. Creatures with 3 or fewer hit dice cannot pass through it, and no creature can see through it to the other side. Passing through the fire inflicts 1d6 hit points of damage (no saving throw) and undead creatures sustain twice the normal damage. The caster may choose to create a straight wall 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a circular wall with a 15 foot radius, also 20 feet high.
1. As a Wall of Ice spell, the caster conjures up a 6 foot thick wall of ice. The caster may choose to create a straight wall 60 feet long and 20 feet high, or a circular wall with a 15 foot radius, also 20 feet high. Creatures with 3 or fewer hit dice cannot affect the wall, but creatures of 4+ hit dice are able to smash through it, taking 1d6 points of damage in the process. Creatures with fire-based metabolisms take 2d6 instead of the normal 1d6. Fire spells and magical effects are negated in the vicinity of the wall.

### **Web**
Spell Level: M2

Range: 30 ft.

Duration: 8 hours

Fibrous, sticky webs fill an area up to 10 × 10 × 20 feet. It is extremely difficult to get through the mass of strands—it takes one turn if a torch and sword (or a flaming sword) are used, and creatures larger than a horse can break through in 2 turns. Humans take longer to break through—perhaps 3 to 4 turns or longer at the Referee’s discretion. 

### **Wizard Eye**
Spell Level: M4

Range: 240 ft.

Duration: 1 hour

The caster conjures up an invisible, magical “eye,” that can move a maximum of 240 feet from its creator. It floats along as directed by the caster, at a rate of 120 feet per turn.

### **Wizard Lock**

Range: Close

Duration: Permanent until dispelled

As with a Hold Portal spell, but it is permanent until dispelled. Creatures with magic resistance can shatter the spell without effort.

## **Chapter 7**
**Running the Game**

Running a game of SWORDS & WIZARDRY: WHITEBOX is a lot easier than running most other role-playing games, simply because there are not as many rules and your own discretion overrides them anyway. Most situations are handled by making “common sense” decisions concerning what happens next. 

For example, if there are a bunch of zombies around the next corner and the Players decide not to go around that corner, it’s up to the Referee to determine whether or not it makes sense for the zombies to rush around the corner and attack—or whether their orders are to simply stay where they are. If a Player decides that his character is going to jump through a wall of fire, with several bottles of flammable oil in his backpack, it’s up to the Referee to determine whether or not they explode.

This means “making up” a lot of stuff on the spot. If you’re not a good storyteller or if you’re not up to doing a lot of creative thinking on the fly, it might be better that you try a different game—one that provides more rules and guidance for every little situation that might arise. But if you’re a good storyteller, creative and fair, SWORDS & WIZARDRY: WHITEBOX’s small, Spartan rule-set frees up your creativity to create a fantasy role-playing experience completely different from the type of game that depends on a multitude of rules.

SWORDS & WIZARDRY: WHITEBOX also frees up your creativity in terms of customizing the game. Unlike a more complex game, you can add house rules wherever you want to without accidentally messing up something else buried in the rules. If you want to use critical hits and fumbles, add ‘em in. You won’t break anything—there’s not that much to break!

### **Designing an Adventure**
Basically, the “adventure” is just the setting for the game—usually a map and then notes about certain locations on that map. As the Players tell you where their characters go and what they do, you’re referring to the map and your notes to describe what happens as a result. Don’t try to plan for all contingencies—it’s guaranteed that the players will do something unexpected during the adventure and you’ll just have to roll with it, thinking on your feet and making up new things as you go. Just as you challenge the Players with adventure, they challenge you to keep up with their collective creativity.

### **Creating a Campaign**
A campaign is the world beyond the adventure—the cities, forests, coastlines, and kingdoms of the fantasy world. The players will almost certainly want their characters to explore the wilderness, visit cities, and do all sorts of things in the fantasy world. At the beginning of the game, you might want to sketch out a map of a single village (as the starting point) and some of the surrounding area. (The location of the first adventure—a dark forest, perhaps) As the players move their characters around from adventure to adventure, you can expand the little map into an entire fantasy world with the continents, kingdoms, and great empires at your disposal.

If you want to take a shortcut, you can set your entire campaign in a fictional world created by the author of one of your favorite fantasy stories. Most of these have maps and the author has already created the details and feel of the world for you. For example, the worlds of Conan’s Hyboria (Robert E. Howard), of Elric and the Eternal Champions (Michael Moorcock), and of the Dying Earth (Jack Vance) are popular fictional settings ready for gaming. Indeed, publishers have already created pre-packaged campaigns for all three of these examples.

### **Experience Points**
Experience Points are awarded to Players for gaining treasure and killing monsters, as an earlier Player’s section has described. It may seem counter-intuitive that treasure somehow makes characters more experienced, but that’s not what awarding experience for gold pieces is all about. Gold pieces are an after-the-fact measurement of how ingenious the character (Player) was in getting them. The gold pieces are not the source of the experience—they are the measurable product of it.

That being said, there are many alterative ways for Referees to award XP. For example, active participation in the campaign might warrant experience for each hour of real-time play, as could solving puzzles and aiding allies. A particularly clever solution or epic victory might warrant double the normal XP amount awarded, while an abysmal failure might merit half.

Some Referees make all earned Experience Points a part of a community total to be divided evenly, since not all the characters have the same opportunities in a given adventure. Others prefer a more competitive game, whereby each player earns XP according to individual accomplishments.

If you find that whatever system you’re using leads the players toward bad decisions—seeking out unnecessary combat or looking for traps to spring—you might consider adjusting your system. This is true for the “official” system of awarding experience as well. Remember, the Referee is the ultimate judge of what works best for a game and any rule can be changed to fit the group.

### **Scale of Advancement**
Referees all have their own style of campaign, and it would be silly for one author to impose needless restrictions on anyone playing the game. However, it is worth noting that this rules set was designed with the notion that 4th level characters are “heroic” and thus the tables were capped at level 10. A Referee who wishes to extend the tables to higher levels is encouraged to do so if it fits the style of the campaign.

## **Chapter 8**
**Monsters**

There’s not a lot of detail given about the monsters, because the more detail given, the more your own mental image of the fantasy world is going to be locked into a single track. We’re not going to say that giant ants are red, nocturnal, three feet long, and fond of eating Elves. Because, in your mind, they might be blue, diurnal, five feet long, and eat only plants unless attacked. Details about monsters toss roadblocks in front of the imagination. Yes, details can also inspire imagination, but we’re making the assumption that if you’re interested in fantasy gaming in the first place, you’ve got a good imagination as-is and don’t require details about the size of a giant ant.

One important characteristic of all monsters, though, is that they can see in the dark.

The following is a quick reference guide for how to read monster descriptions:

*Armor Class*

“Armor Class” is explained earlier in the rules for combat. If you’re using the Descending AC system (where lower AC is better), disregard the numbers in brackets. If you’re using the Ascending AC system (where a high AC is better), use the numbers in brackets.

*Attacks*

“Attacks” lists the number of attacks a monster has and the damage they inflict. Most monsters have one attack and inflict 1d6 damage—there are, however, some exceptions.

*Experience Points*

“Experience Points” are presented after a monster’s Hit Dice Equivalent (HDE) rating, and list the number of XP the adventuring party gains as a result of killing the creature. In some cases, however, the Referee may choose to award experience points for defeating a creature without killing it (circumventing it by creative means, capturing it to bring home, etc.). Some monsters have multiple Experience Points listed—this is because certain monsters have a range of hit dice. Order is always from lowest HD to highest HD.

*Hit Dice*

“Hit Dice” is the number of dice (d6) rolled to determine an individual creature’s HP. If there is a plus or minus after the number, add or subtract that number once from the total rolled.


*Hit Dice Equivalent*

“Hit Dice Equivalent” is used to separate monsters into “difficulty levels” so that when creating an adventure the Referee has some guidelines concerning what characters can and cannot handle. Some monsters have multiple HDE’s listed—this is because certain monsters have a range of hit dice. Order is always from lowest HD to highest HD.

*Magic Resistance*

“Magic Resistance” isn’t one of the entries, but some creatures may have “magic resistance.” The given percentage chance is the likelihood that any magic used against the creature (other than bonuses from weapons) will fail to take effect. To determine whether or not magic used will have an impact, roll a d100. The magic fails if the result is less than the given percentage.

*Move*

“Move” is the monster’s movement rate and is handled like it is for PCs.

*Saving Throw*

“Saving Throw” isn’t one of the entries, but all creatures have a saving throw. It is the number on the d20 the monster needs to equal or exceed in order to avoid a threat or lessen its effect. It is found by subtracting the monster’s HD from 19. For example, a monster with 4 HD has a saving throw of 15. Alternatively, a monster can simply be treated as a Fighter or whatever character class makes sense for that monster, with the monster’s hit dice being used for its level.

*Special*

“Special” is just a “flag” of sorts for the Referee that serves as a reminder that a monster has a special ability.

#########
######### **Note**
######### If you are using the quick formula for calculating attacks using the ascending armor class system, the monster’s normal “to-hit” bonus is equal to its hit dice (capped at +15). For example, a monster with 3 HD attacks with a +3 “to-hit” bonus.
#########
######### **Monster Descriptions**
Contained herein are all of the monsters presented in alphabetical order.

### **Banshee**
Armor Class: 0 [19]

Hit Dice: 7

Attacks: Claw

Special: See below

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 11/1,700

Banshees are horrid fey (or undead) creatures that live in swamps and other desolate places. They can only be harmed by magical or silver weapons. Banshees have a 49% resistance to magic, and they are immune to enchantments. Their shriek (once per day) necessitates a saving throw versus death or the hearer will die in 2d6 rounds. They can travel over water and other terrain as if it were land, but crossing running water causes it to lose its magic resistance for 3d6 hours. They look like gaunt humans with long, stringy hair and glowing yellow eyes. They often wear hooded cloaks. At the Referee’s discretion, such creatures might be undead rather than faerie-folk, and are considered to have 9 HD for turning purposes.

### **Basilisk**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 6

Attacks: Bite

Special: Petrifying gaze

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 8/800

Basilisks are great lizards whose gaze turns to stone anyone meeting its eye (fighting without looking incurs a -4 penalty “to-hit”). If the basilisk’s own gaze is reflected back at it, it has a 10% chance to force the basilisk into a saving throw against being turned to stone itself.

### **Beetle, Giant Fire**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 1+3

Attacks: Bite

Special: None

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 1/15

A giant fire beetle’s oily light-glands glow red, and continue to give off light for 1d6 days after they are removed (shedding light in a 10 foot radius).

### **Black Pudding**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 10

Attacks: Strike

Special: Acidic

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 11/1,700

Black puddings are amorphous globs with an acidic surface. They are subterranean predators and scavengers. Any weapon or armor contacting a black pudding will be eaten away by the acid as follows: weapon (1 hit by weapon), chain mail or lesser armor (1 hit by pudding), plate mail (2 hits by pudding). If a weapon or armor is magical, it can take an additional hit per +1 before being dissolved. They are immune to cold and divide when attacked by lightning.

### **Blink Dog**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 6

Attacks: Bite

Special: Teleport

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 4/240

Blink dogs are pack hunters, intelligent and usually friendly to those who are not of evil intent. They can teleport short distances (without error) and attack in the same turn—in most cases (75%) a blink dog will be able to teleport behind an opponent and attack from the rear (with bonuses).

### **Bugbear**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 3+1

Attacks: Weapon or bite

Special: Surprise opponents

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 3/120

These large, hairy, goblin-like humanoids are stealthier than their size would suggest, almost always getting the chance to surprise even the most alert opponents with a roll of 1–3 on a d6 (50% of the time).

### **Centaur**
Armor Class: 5 [14], 4 [16] w/ shield

Hit Dice: 4

Attacks: Weapon or kick

Special: None

Move: 18

HDE/XP: 5/240

Half man, half horse, centaurs are fierce warriors and well-known creatures of mythology. The Referee may choose any “version” of the centaur from folklore for his campaign: some are chaotic, some aloof, and some are soothsayers.

**Centipede, Giant (small)**

Armor Class: 9 [10]

Hit Dice: 1d2 HP

Attacks: Bite

Special: Poison (see below)

Move: 13

HDE/XP: 2/30

Giant lethal centipedes of the small size inflict a lethal amount of poison with each bite, but inflict no damage if the saving throw is successful (+4 modifier to opponent’s saving throw).

**Centipede, Giant (medium)**

Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 2

Attacks: Bite

Special: Poison (see below)

Move: 15

HDE/XP: 4/240

This man-sized giant centipede is a deadly predator with armored segments, a vicious bite, and a lethal (though relatively weak) poison (+6 modifier to opponent’s saving throw).

**Centipede, Giant (large)**

Armor Class: 0 [19]

Hit Dice: 4

Attacks: Bite

Special: Poison (see below)

Move: 18

HDE/XP: 6/400

A twenty-foot long horror of chitin, multiple legs, and clashing pincers dripping with venom (+6 modifier to opponent’s saving throw).

### **Chimera**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 9

Attacks: Bite (equals # of heads)

Special: Breathes fire, flies

Move: 12/18 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 11/1,700

The chimera is a winged, three headed beast; one is the head of a goat, one the head of a lion, and one the head of a dragon. The dragon head can breathe fire (3 times per day) with a range of 50 feet, causing 3d8 damage to anyone caught within the fiery blast (saving throw for half damage).

### **Cockatrice**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 5

Attacks: Bite

Special: Bite turns bitten into stone

Move: 6/18 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 7/600

Resembles a bat-winged rooster with a long, serpentine tail. Its bite turns enemies to stone unless a successful saving throw is made.

### **Demons**
Demons are creatures of the lower planes of existence, but they are occasionally encountered in places where they have been enslaved to serve as guardians by powerful Magic-users or Chaotic Clerics. The more intelligent varieties might also be interrupted while carrying out plots of their own. There is no meaningful game distinction between demons and devils.

### **Demon, Baalroch**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 9

Attacks: Sword or whip (2d6)

Special: See below

Move: 6/15 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 10/1,400

The Baalroch’s name means, roughly, the Bull of Baal: the Baal-aurochs (the aurochs was a bull that stood twelve feet tall at the shoulder, and Baal is an ancient and evil pagan deity). These powerful demons somewhat resemble vast minotaurs with great, spreading bat-wings; they burn with the fires of hell and are wreathed in flame. The spells of casters below 6th level do not affect them, and against higher-level spell casters they are yet 75% immune to all spells. In combat, a Baalroch uses whip and sword; the whip can be used to reach great distances—on a successful hit the victim is pulled close to the Baalroch and burned by the fires of the demon’s body (3d6 damage). Baalrochs are sometimes referred to in ancient texts as Balor or Baalor, which may be the name of a single demon rather than a term for all of them. A Baalroch could be forced or tricked into the service of a powerful wizard, but the risk would be immense.

### **Demon, Lemure**
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Hit Dice: 3

Attacks: Claw

Special: Regenerate (1 HP/round)

Move: 3

HDE/XP: 4/120

Lemures are vaguely humanoid—their flesh is mud-like, shifting and soft upon their horrible bodies. Like manes and wretches, lemures are lower forms of demons, the fleshly manifestations of damned souls. These demons can only be permanently destroyed by sprinkling their disgusting bodies with holy water.

### **Djinni**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 7+1

Attacks: Fist or weapon (2d6)

Special: See below

Move: 9/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 9/1,100

Djinn are one of the genies of folklore, creatures of the air (and possibly of the elemental planes). They can carry 700 pounds of weight, and have a number of magical powers. A djinni can create food and water of high quality, as well as wooden and cloth objects. They can also create objects of metal (including coins), but all such magically created metals disappear in time. Djinn can call up illusions, and although these are quite excellent they disappear when touched. Djinni can turn themselves into gaseous form (cannot attack or be attacked, can enter any area that is not airtight), and can become invisible at will. Finally, a djinni can turn itself into a whirlwind much like an air elemental, sweeping away any creature with one or fewer hit dice (the diameter of the whirlwind is 10 feet). More powerful types of djinn might be capable of granting limited wishes or even true wishes.

### **Doppelganger**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 4

Attacks: Claw

Special: See below

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 5/240

A doppelganger can change its form to resemble the physical appearance (including clothing and gear) of any person. These creatures are immune to sleep and charm, and are considered magic resistant for purposes such as breaking through wizard locks and similar spells. They have a very good saving throw (+5) against magic of all kinds.

###### **Dragons**
All dragons have a breath weapon of some kind, which can be used up to three times in a day. The Referee chooses when a dragon will use the breath weapon or may roll for it (50% chance) in any given round.

Referees should not roll for a dragon’s hit points, like one would for other monsters. Instead, determine the age category of the dragon—this will give both the dragon’s hit points per hit dice and how many points of breath weapon damage per hit dice the dragon inflicts.

### **Dragon Age Category**

|**Roll**|**Age**|**Hit Points/Hit Dice**|**Damage/Hit Dice**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|1|Very Young|1|1|
|2|Young|2|2|
|3|Immature|3|3|
|4|Adult|4|4|
|5|Old|5|5|
|6|Very Old (100 years)|6|6|
|7|Aged (100–400)|7|7|
|8|Ancient (400+)|8|8|

### **Dragon Breath Weapons**

|**Shape\***|**Type**|
| :-: | :-: |
|Cloud|Gaseous|
|Cone|Fiery/Frosty|
|Line|Spitting|
\* The dimensions of a dragon’s breath differ according to the dragon’s type. For example, an “Adult” dragon has both 4 hit points and 4 points of breath weapon damage per hit dice. So an “Adult” black dragon with 6 HD would have 24 HP and deal 24 points of acid damage when using its breath weapon.

Note that dragons, while dangerous opponents, are not by any means invincible. In a medieval-type fantasy world, dragons are a common problem rather than a godlike creature of legend—so the statistics for dragons reflect a deadly but not mythical foe. The Referee is, of course, free to create stats for a more “mythical” conception of dragons. Since dice aren’t rolled for dragon hit points, it is possible for a truly mythical dragon to have more “numbers” per die than it’s actually possible to roll on a hit dice.

### **Dragon, Black**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 6–8

Attacks: Bite

Special: Spits acid

Move: 12/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 8/800; 9/1,100; 10/1,400

Black dragons spit a deadly, corrosive acid rather than a breath of fire. The acid covers everything in a line 5 feet wide and 60 feet long.

### **Dragon, Blue**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 8–10

Attacks: Bite

Special: Spits lightning

Move: 12/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 10/1,400; 11/1,700; 12/2,000

Blue dragons spit a blast of electric lightning, affecting everything in its path, in a line 5 feet wide and 100 feet long. A successful saving throw against the blast of lightning indicates half damage.

### **Dragon, Gold**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 10–12

Attacks: Bite

Special: Breathes poisonous gas or fire

Move: 12/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 12/2,000; 13/2,300; 14/2,600

Gold dragons are of lawful alignment, can always speak, and cast spells as if they were a Magic-user of equal level to their age category (so that “Very Old” gold dragons are 6th level Magic-users). They can choose to either breathe fire in a cone 90 feet long and roughly 30 feet wide at the base or breathe chlorine gas in a cloud 50 feet in diameter.

### **Dragon, Green**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 7–9

Attacks: Bite

Special: Breathes poisonous gas

Move: 12/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700

Green dragons breathe a cloud of poisonous gas that is 50 feet in diameter. A successful saving throw indicates half damage.

### **Dragon, Red**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 9–11

Attacks: Bite

Special: Breathes fire

Move: 12/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 11/1,700; 12/2,000; 13/2,300

Red dragons are the fire-breathing wyrms of legend. They breathe fire in a cone-shape 90 feet long and roughly 30 feet wide at the base.

### **Dragon, White**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 5–7

Attacks: Bite

Special: Breathes cold

Move: 12/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 7/600; 8/800; 9/1,100

White dragons are usually found in cold regions, where they can utilize their natural camouflage in the ice and snow to ambush their prey. They breathe intensely cold air and frost in a cone shape 70 feet long and roughly 30 feet wide at the base.

### **Dryad**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 2

Attacks: Dagger, wooden

Special: Charm Person

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 3/60

Dryads are beautiful female tree spirits, and do not venture far from their home trees. They can cast (as a native magical power) a strong charm that operates as a Charm Person spell with a -2 saving throw. Those who are charmed seldom return, or might be kept for a hundred years and a day within the dryad’s tree.

### **Dwarf**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 1+1

Attacks: War Hammer

Special: Stonework insight

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 1/15

Statistics above are for the common Dwarf with no particular unusual characteristics. A Dwarf-at-arms would usually have a full 7 HP, reflecting skill and general toughness. Stronger Dwarves (sergeants-at-arms, for example) might have more hit dice or unusual bonuses “to-hit”, even magical abilities if Dwarves are magical in your fantasy universe. (Norse myths are a good example of this.) Do not bother to treat more powerful NPC Dwarves as Fighters or character types; just assign the right number of HD and abilities (if any) and keep moving along with the fantasy.

### **Efreeti**
Armor Class: 3 [16]

Hit Dice: 10

Attacks: Fist or sword (2d6)

Special: Wall of Fire

Move: 9/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 12/2,000

Efreet are a type of genie, associated with fire (unlike the djinn, who have powers over the air). Efreet can carry up to a thousand pounds of weight, and under the right circumstances they can be forced to serve as a slave (until they figure out how to free themselves). An efreeti can cast Wall of Fire. They appear as giant humans with cruel features, their skin flickering with flames.

###### **Elementals**
Elementals are living manifestations of the basic forms of matter; earth, air, fire, and water. They are usually summoned from their native planes of existence to do the bidding of a powerful wizard. These beings can also be “chained” within objects or structures to give the objects magical properties. Elementals are barely intelligent at all, but they are as powerful as the forces of nature that they actually are.

### **Elemental, Air**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 8, 12, 16

Attacks: Strike (2d6)

Special: Whirlwind

Move: 36 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 9/1,100; 13/2,300; 17/3,400

Air elementals can turn into a whirlwind of air with a diameter of 30 feet, hurling any creature of 1 HD or less for great distances (almost certainly killing them). Elemental whirlwinds are approximately 100 feet tall.

### **Elemental, Earth**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 8, 12, 16

Attacks: Fist (2d6)

Special: Stone destruction

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 9/1,100; 13/2,300; 17/3,400

Earth elementals are hulking man-shapes of rock and earth. They batter opponents with their great fists, although damage is reduced by 1d6 if the opponent is not standing upon earth or rock. Earth elementals can tear apart stone structures, able to rip down even a castle wall in a matter of 1d4+4 minutes.

### **Elemental, Fire**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 8, 12, 16

Attacks: Strike (2d6)

Special: Ignite materials

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 9/1,100; 13/2,300; 17/3,400

Fire elementals are formless masses of flame, perhaps with a vaguely human shape. Their attacks cause flammable materials to ignite if the material fails a saving throw (as determined by the Referee).

### **Elemental, Water**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 8, 12, 16

Attacks: Strike (2d6)

Special: Overturn ships

Move: 6/18 (when swimming)

HDE/XP: 9/1,100; 13/2,300; 17/3,400

Water elementals cannot move more than 60 feet from a large body of water, and their damage is reduced by 1d6 if the opponent is not standing (or in) a body of water. These powerful beings can overturn small boats, and can overturn a ship if given 1d4+4 minutes to work at it. On water, they can attack ships, battering them to pieces within one hour if not prevented or distracted.

### **Elf**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 1+1

Attacks: Longbow or sword

Special: None

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 1/15

The example above is for a typical Elf; trained warriors would likely have the maximum 7 HP. Obviously, Elves encountered in the course of a party’s adventuring will have a variety of powers and different attributes. The Referee will assign such powers as he sees fit, in accordance with the way he envisions Elves. They might be the woodland dwellers of Tolkien’s The Hobbit, or the high Elves of the Lord of the Rings, or might be the faerie-folk of Irish legend. In any case, as with Dwarves, don’t bother trying to fit your “advanced” elves into the constraints of character classes—just make up their attributes to fit what you need. NPCs aren’t subject to the rules that govern building a player character; they are your tools for good fantasy, not an exercise in formula application.

### **Gargoyle**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 4

Attacks: Claw

Special: Flight

Move: 9/15 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 6/400

Gargoyles are winged creatures resembling the carved monstrosities that bedeck the walls of cathedrals and many subterranean dungeons. They can be vicious predators.

### **Gelatinous Cube**
Armor Class: 8 [11]

Hit Dice: 4

Attacks: Strike

Special: See below

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 5/240

Gelatinous cubes are semi-transparent cubes that slosh through subterranean passages, engulfing debris and carrion to digest. Their entire substance is acidic: if the cube hits successfully, the victim must make a saving throw or become paralyzed (6 turns)—during which time the cube will attempt to devour its victim. Most gelatinous cubes contain various metallic treasures or gems that they have engulfed but not yet digested. Gelatinous cubes are immune to lightning and cold.
### **Ghoul**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 2

Attacks: Claw

Special: See below

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 3/60

Ghouls are pack-hunting undead, corpse eaters. They are immune, like most undead, to charms and sleep spells. The most dangerous feature of these horrid, cunning creatures is their paralyzing touch: any hit from a ghoul requires a saving throw or the victim becomes paralyzed for 3d6 turns.

###### **Giants**
Giants are a staple of fantasy gaming, huge and dangerous creatures that often have a taste for human flesh. Most are not particularly intelligent.

### **Giant, Cloud**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 12+2

Attacks: Weapon (3d6)

Special: Hurls boulders

Move: 15

HDE/XP: 13/2,300

Cloud giants are cunning beasts, often living in cloud-castles in the sky (hence their name). They throw rocks for 6d6 hit points of damage. Cloud giants are famous for their ability to smell out food, enemies, and Englishmen.

### **Giant, Fire**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 11+3

Attacks: Weapon (2d6)

Special: Hurls boulders, fire immunity

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 12/2,000

Fire giants are usually found near volcanic mountains, in great castles of basalt or even iron. They throw boulders for 5d6 hit points and are immune to fire.

### **Giant, Frost**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 10+1

Attacks: Weapon (2d6)

Special: Hurls boulders, cold immunity

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 12/2,000

Frost giants dwell in cold regions, where they build (or conquer) castles in remote places of ice and snow. They throw boulders or great chunks of ice for 4d6 points of damage and are immune to cold.

### **Giant, Hill**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 8

Attacks: Weapon (2d6)

Special: Hurls boulders

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 9/1,100

Hill giants are the least of the giant races; most are brutish cave-dwellers who dress in pelts and uncured hides. They throw rocks for 2d8 points of damage.

### **Giant, Stone**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 9

Attacks: Club (2d6)

Special: Hurls boulders

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 10/1,400

Stone giants dwell in caves, isolated in the mountain fastness. They throw rocks for 3d6 points of damage, and can be quite crafty in setting up ambushes in their native mountains—travelers who wander into the territory of stone giants seldom return.

### **Giant, Storm**
Armor Class: 1 [18]

Hit Dice: 16

Attacks: Weapon (3d6)

Special: See below

Move: 15

HDE/XP: 16/3,200

Storm giants are the largest of giants, the most intelligent, the most magical, and the most likely to talk with humans rather than simply devour them. Storm giants can live in underwater sea-castles as well as on the heights of mountains. They throw boulders for 7d6 points of damage, and have the power to cast Control Weather.

### **Gnoll**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 2

Attacks: Bite

Special: None

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 2/30

Gnolls are tall humanoids with hyena-like heads. They may be found both above ground and in subterranean caverns. They form into loosely organized clans, often ranging far from home to steal and kill with rapacious ferocity.

### **Goblin**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 1-1

Attacks: Weapon

Special: -1 “to-hit” in sunlight

Move: 9

HDE/XP: < 1/10

Goblins are small creatures (4 feet tall or so) that inhabit dark woods, underground caverns, and (possibly) the otherworldly realms of the fey. They attack with a -1 “to-hit” in the full sunlight.

###### **Golems**
Golems are man-shaped creatures built to serve their masters, usually powerful wizards or high priests. They are often used as guardians. Golems cannot be hit with non-magical weapons, and are immune to the sorts of spells used to create them (iron golems being immune to fire, for instance). You can find the details in the specific monster descriptions.

### **Golem, Flesh**
Armor Class: 9 [10]

Hit Dice: 12

Attacks: Fist

Special: See below

Move: 8

HDE/XP: 12/2,000

A creation stitched together from human limbs and other parts, like Frankenstein’s monster. Damage inflicted by lightning heals the golem, and it is slowed by fire and cold. No other type of spell than lightning, fire, or cold affects a flesh golem. Only +1 or better magic weapons can harm a flesh golem.

### **Golem, Iron**
Armor Class: 3 [16]

Hit Dice: 13

Attacks: Fist or weapon

Special: See below

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 17/3,500

Iron golems are huge moving statues of iron. They can breathe a 10 foot radius cloud of poison gas as well as attacking with great power. Only +3 or better magic weapons can harm an iron golem. These hulking statues are slowed by lightning spells, but fire-based spells actually restore hit points to them. No other type of spell affects them.

### **Golem, Stone**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 16

Attacks: Fist

Special: See below

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 16/3,200

Stone golems are massive stone statues animated by very powerful magics (much more than just animate object, in other words). They are slowed by fire spells, and damaged/healed by rock to mud spells and the reverse. Spells that affect rock (and fire spells) are the only magic that affects them. They can only be hit by weapons +2 or better.

### **Gorgon**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 8

Attacks: Gore

Special: Stone breath

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 10/1,400 

Gorgons are bull-like creatures with dragon-like scales. Their breath turns people to stone (60 foot range, saving throw applies).

### **Grey Ooze**
Armor Class: 8 [11]

Hit Dice: 3

Attacks: Strike

Special: See below

Move: 1

HDE/XP: 5/240

Grey ooze is almost identical to wet rock, but is a slimy, formless substance that devours prey and carrion with its acidic secretions, lashing forward to strike enemies. Grey ooze is immune to spells, heat, and cold damage. Metal (but not stone or wood) must make a saving throw vs. acid when exposed to grey ooze (even if the contact is as brief as the strike of a sword) or be rotted through. When the grey ooze hits a character in metal armor, the armor must make an item saving throw. Only cutting and piercing damages a grey ooze—it is impervious to blunt or crushing attacks.

### **Green Slime**
Green slime isn’t technically a monster, just an extremely dangerous hazard in underground tombs and other such places. Any metal or organic substance it touches begins to turn to green slime (saving throw). It can be killed with fire or extreme cold, and the transformation process can be arrested by the use of the spell Cure Disease.

### **Griffon**
Armor Class: 3 [16]

Hit Dice: 7

Attacks: Bite

Special: Flight

Move: 12/27 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 8/800

Griffons have the body of a lion, with the wings, head, and fore-talons of an eagle. These creatures can be tamed and ridden as mounts. They usually nest in high mountain aeries, where they lay their eggs and hunt their prey. Because the fledglings can be tamed, young griffons and griffon eggs command a very high price in the marketplaces of the great cities, or to barons and wizards.

### **Harpy**
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Hit Dice: 3

Attacks: Talons

Special: Flight, siren song

Move: 6/18 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 4/120

Harpies have the upper body of a human female and the lower body and wings of a vulture. Their song is a charm that draws its victims to the harpy (saving throw applies), and the harpy’s touch casts the equivalent of a Charm Person spell (again, saving throw applies).

### **Hell Hound**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 4–7

Attacks: Bite

Special: Breathes fire

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 5/240; 6/400; 7/600; 8/800

Hell hounds are fire-breathing dogs of the underworlds or lower planes. In addition to biting, they can breathe fire each round, inflicting 2 HP damage per hit die (10 foot range, saving throw for half damage).

### **Hippogriff**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 3+1

Attacks: Claws

Special: Flight

Move: 12/27 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 3/60

The hippogriff is similar to a griffon, having the head, foreclaws, and wings of an eagle, but instead of the body of a lion, it has the body of a horse. The poem Orlando Furioso (written in 1516) suggests that the hippogriff is the offspring of a griffon and a horse—but they are apparently an independent breed, for folkloric tradition holds that griffons frequently attack hippogriffs. Hippogriffs are not as hard to train as griffons—again, from Orlando Furioso: 

“Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair, The wizard thought but how to tame the foal; And, in a month, instructed him to bear Saddle and bit, and gallop to the goal; And execute on earth or in mid air, All shifts of manege, course and caracole…”

### **Hobgoblin**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 1+1

Attacks: Weapon

Special: None

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 1/15

Hobgoblins are simply large goblins, possibly a separate breed living apart from their smaller cousins. As a matter of the campaign’s flavoring, the Referee might choose to make hobgoblins the “fey” goblins of Irish legend, while regular goblins are the more Tolkien-style underground-dwellers.

### **Horse**
Horses are AC 7 [12], with riding horses having 2 HD and warhorses having 3 HD. Horses move at a speed of 18.

###### **Humans**
Humans are such a versatile race that any number of “monsters” and NPCs can be made from them. Berserker warriors, tribesmen, cavemen, princesses, evil high priests, captains of the guard, foot-soldiers, and tavern-keepers are all different human “monsters.”

Don’t try to build your non-player characters according to the rules for player characters. Here are some samples, otherwise just make up their stats and abilities as you see fit.

### **Human, Bandit**
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Hit Dice: 1

Attacks: Weapon

Special: None

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 1/15

Bandits are roving groups of thieves, sometimes organized into small armies led by more powerful bandit chiefs and captains with higher hit dice.

### **Human, Berserker**
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Hit Dice: 1+2

Attacks: Weapon

Special: Berserking

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 2/30

Berserkers are normal humans, but they fight with astounding ferocity. A bonus of +2 is added to their attack rolls. They do not wear armor heavier than leather armor.

### **Human, Sergeant-at-Arms**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 3

Attacks: Weapon

Special: None

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 3/60

Human sergeants are normally found in command of 1d6+5 human soldiers. These are the leaders of city guard units and other small military groups in castles and armies.

### **Human, Soldier**
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Hit Dice: 1

Attacks: Weapon

Special: None

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 1/15

Human soldiers serve as city guardsmen, mercenaries, and men-at-arms. They are generally armed with leather armor and a mace, sword, or spear. For every five guardsmen there is usually a sergeant.

### **Hydra**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 5–12 (equals # of heads)

Attacks: 5–12 bites

Special: See below

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 7/600; 8/800; 9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700; 12/2,000

Hydrae are great lizard-like or snake-like creatures with 5–12 heads. Each head has one hit die of its own, and when the head is killed, that head dies. The body has as many hit dice as the total of the heads, so it is a matter of good strategy for adventurers to focus either on killing heads (when all the heads are dead the body dies) or killing the creature by attacking the body (in which case the heads die, too). Hydrae that breathe fire or regenerate their heads are known to exist.

### **Invisible Stalker**
Armor Class: 3 [16]

Hit Dice: 8

Attacks: Bite

Special: Flight, invisibility

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 9/1,100

Invisible stalkers are generally only found as a result of the spell Invisible Stalker. They are invisible flying beings created to follow a single command made by the caster.

### **Kobold**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 1/2

Attacks: Weapon

Special: None

Move: 6

HDE/XP: < 1/10

Kobolds are subterranean, vaguely goblin-like humanoids. They have a -1 “to-hit” penalty when fighting above ground. Many use slings or short bows, and they fight with short swords or spiked clubs in melee combat.

### **Liche**
Armor Class: 0 [19]

Hit Dice: 12–18

Attacks: Touch

Special: See below

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 15/2,900; 16/3,200; 17/3,500; 18/3,800; 19/4,100; 20/4,400; 21/4,700

Liches are the undead remnants of wizards, either made undead by their own deliberate acts during life or as the result of other magical forces (possibly including their own magics gone awry). A liche has the same spell-casting powers as the original Magic-user (the same level as the liche’s HD). A liche’s touch causes paralysis with no saving throw, and the very sight of one of these dread creatures causes paralysis in any being of 4 HD or below. Liches are highly malign and intelligent.

### **Lizardman**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 2+1

Attacks: Claw or sword

Special: See below

Move: 6/12 (when swimming)

HDE/XP: 2/30

Lizardmen are reptilian humanoids, usually living in tribal villages in the depths of fetid swamps. Some can hold their breath for a long duration (an hour or more), while others can actually breathe underwater. Some lizardmen wield a wicked sword made of sharp bone.

###### **Lycanthropes**
Lycanthropes are were-creatures, particularly those in whom the disease permits assumption of a hybrid form of the human and animal. They cannot be hit by normal weapons; only silver or magical weapons inflict damage on them. If any character is brought low 50% hit points by a lycanthrope, the character will become a lycanthrope himself.

### **Lycanthrope, Werebear**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 7+3

Attacks: Bite

Special: Lycanthropy

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 8/800

Werebears are often found in temperate forests.

### **Lycanthrope, Wererat**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 3

Attacks: Weapon

Special: Control rats, lycanthropy

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 4/120

Wererats are mostly found in cities, lurking in shadowy alleyways. Wererats can control rats, and are extremely stealthy (surprising opponents 1–4 on a d6).

### **Lycanthrope, Werewolf**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 3

Attacks: Bite or Claw

Special: Lycanthropy

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 4/120

Werewolves are the traditional Lycanthropes seen in horror movies. They are often only affected by silver or magical weapons, and are often humanoid—except for during a full moon, and so on.

### **Manticore**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 6+4

Attacks: Tail-spikes 

Special: Flight

Move: 12/8(when flying)

HDE/XP: 8/800

A horrid monster with bat wings, the face of a feral human, the body of a lion, and a tail tipped with 24 iron spikes. The manticore can hurl up to 6 of the iron spikes from its tail per round, at a maximum range of 180 feet.

### **Medusa**
Armor Class: 8 [11]

Hit Dice: 6

Attacks: Poisoned bite or weapon

Special: Petrifying gaze

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 8/800

Medusae are horrid creatures from Greek mythology with a female face but hair of writhing snakes; they have no legs, but the body of a serpent. The gaze of a medusa turns anyone looking upon it into stone. In addition to the medusa’s relatively weak melee-weapon attack, the snake-hair makes one attack per round, causing no damage but lethally poisonous with a successful hit (saving throw applies).

### **Minotaur**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 6+4

Attacks: Weapon

Special: Never lost in labyrinths

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 6/400

The minotaur is a man-eating predator from Greek mythology, with the head of a bull and the body of a massive human, covered in shaggy hair. Sometimes they wield large axes and most are not particularly intelligent.

### **Mummy**
Armor Class: 3 [16]

Hit Dice: 5+1

Attacks: Touch (See below)

Special: See below

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 7/600

Mummies cannot be hit by normal weapons and even magical weapons inflict only half damage against them. Their touch also inflicts a rotting disease which prevents magical healing and causes wounds to heal at one-tenth of the normal rate. A Cure Disease spell can increase healing rate to half normal, but a Remove Curse spell is required to completely lift the mummy’s curse.

### **Ochre Jelly**
Armor Class: 8 [11]

Hit Dice: 5

Attacks: Acid strike

Special: Lightning divides creature

Move: 3

HDE/XP: 6/400

Ochre jellies are amorphous oozes that damage opponents with their acidic surface. They dissolve any adventurers they kill, making the spell Raise Dead all but impossible.

### **Ogre**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 4+1

Attacks: Weapon

Special: None

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 4/120

Ogres are normally quite stupid, but more intelligent versions might be encountered here and there. Sometimes ogres are mistaken for trolls.

### **Ogre Mage**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 5+4

Attacks: Weapon

Special: Magic

Move: 12/18 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 7/600

The ogre mage is an ogre with magic powers, based on Japanese legend. An ogre mage can fly, turn invisible (per the spell), create a 10 foot radius circle of magical darkness, change into human form, cast Sleep and Charm Person once per day, and cast a cone of frost with a range of 60 feet to a base of 30 feet, causing 8d6 damage to any caught within (saving throw applies). Western folklore also contains many examples of shape-shifting, magical ogres (the most famous example being the one in Puss-in-Boots), so there might be many different types of magical ogres, whether or not they are called “ogre mage.”

### **Orc**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 1

Attacks: Weapon

Special: None

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 1/15

Orcs are stupid, brutish humanoids that gather in tribes of hundreds. Most are subterranean dwellers, and fight with a -1 penalty “to-hit” in sunlight. Occasionally, war-bands or even entire tribes of orcs issue forth from their caverns to raid and pillage by night. Orcish leaders are great brutes with additional HD, and magic-using shamans may also be found in the larger tribes. Orcish tribes hate each other, and will fight savagely unless restrained by a powerful and feared commander, such as an evil high priest or a mystic sorcerer.

### **Pegasus**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 2+2

Attacks: Hooves

Special: Flight

Move: 24/48 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 4/120

Pegasus was the winged horse from Greek mythology. Other Pegasus creatures might have bat wings, some might be chaotic; such choices are left entirely up to the Referee.

### **Purple Worm**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 15

Attacks: Bite or sting

Special: Poison sting

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 17/3,500

Purple worms are massive annelids that grow 40+ feet in length and sometimes exceed 10 feet in width. They are subterranean, chewing tunnels in rock (or through sand, in deserts, where they are a tan color). These beasts swallow their prey whole on a roll 4 higher than the needed number, or if the worm rolls double the number required “to-hit”. They can swallow anything the size of a horse or smaller. 

In addition to the worm’s dreaded bite, it has a poison stinger on its tail, the length of a sword and just as deadly even from the piercing wound it inflicts. The poison injected by the stinger is lethal if the victim fails a saving throw. What prey the purple worms once hunted (or perhaps still do, in deep places) with such natural weapons must have been terrifying indeed. Aquatic versions of the purple worm might also exist.

### **Rat, Giant**
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Hit Dice: 1-1

Attacks: Bite

Special: 5% are diseased

Move: 12

HDE/XP: < 1/10

Giant rats are often found in dungeons, and are about the size of a cat or a lynx. The bite of some (1 in 20) giant rats causes disease. A saving throw vs. poison is allowed. The effects of the disease are decided by the Referee.

### **Roc**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 12

Attacks: Claw

Special: None

Move: 3/30 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 12/2,000

Rocs are the mythological great birds of legend, large enough to prey upon elephants. They can be trained as fledglings to serve as steeds, so roc eggs or fledglings would be a prize indeed, worth great sums of gold. Rocs might grow as large as 18 HD, with commensurately increased statistics.

### **Salamander**
Armor Class: 5 [14], 3 [16]

Hit Dice: 7

Attacks: Constrict or touch

Special: Heat, constriction

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 8/800

Salamanders are intelligent creatures of the elemental planes of fire. They have the upper body of a human (AC 5 [14]) and the lower body of a snake (AC 3 [16]), and give off tremendous, intense heat. The very touch of a salamander deals 1d6 hit points of fire damage, and they wrap their tails around foes to cause an additional 2d6 points of crushing damage per round. Salamanders cannot be enslaved in the same manner djinn and efreet might be.

### **Sea Serpent**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 30

Attacks: Bite

Special: See below

Move: 18 (when swimming)

HDE/XP: 30/8,400

The size and nature of sea serpents is a matter for the Referee to determine. The sea serpent depicted here would be about middle size, about 60 feet in length, with smaller ones being half that size (with adjusted statistics, of course), and large ones being about 50% larger than the one described here. A sea serpent would undoubtedly be capable of swallowing a human whole, probably on a natural attack roll of no more than 14. A character swallowed whole would be digested within, perhaps, three hours.

### **Shadow**
Armor Class: 7 [12]

Hit Dice: 3+3

Attacks: Touch (See below)

Special: See below

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 4/130

Shadows may or may not be undead creatures: they are immune to sleep and charm, but the Referee may decide whether they are undead creatures subject to turning or whether they are some horrible “other” thing, a manifestation perhaps, or a creature from another dimension. Shadows are dark and resemble shadows, though they may be darker. They are not corporeal, and can only be harmed with magical weapons or by spells. Their chill touch drains one point of strength with a successful hit, and if a victim is brought to a strength of 0, he becomes a shadow. Strength points return after 90 minutes.

### **Skeleton**
Armor Class: 8 [11], 7 [12] w/ shield

Hit Dice: 1/2

Attacks: Strike or weapon

Special: None

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 1/15

Skeletons are animated bones of the dead and are usually under the control of some evil master.

### **Slug, Giant**
Armor Class: 8 [11]

Hit Dice: 12

Attacks: Bite

Special: Spits acid (2d6)

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 13/2,300

These tremendously large masses of slimy, rubbery flesh are completely immune to blunt weapons. In addition to their powerful bite, giant slugs can spit their acidic saliva (one target at a time). The base range for spitting is 60 feet, and within this range the slug’s spittle will be 50% likely “to-hit” (no “to-hit” roll required). For every additional 10 feet of range, the chance “to-hit” decreases by 10%. On its first spitting attack, the slug only has a 10% chance “to-hit” within 60 feet, and no chance of hitting beyond that range. Some giant slugs might have more or less virulent acidity (thus changing the damage inflicted). 

### **Specter**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 6

Attacks: Touch (See below)

Special: Drains 2 levels per hit

Move: 15/30 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 9/1,100

Specters are wraith-like undead creatures without corporeal bodies. When a specter hits an opponent, either with hand or weapon, the touch drains two levels from the victim. Only magical weapons can damage a specter. In some cases, these terrifying creatures may be mounted upon living beasts, if the beasts have been trained to tolerate proximity to the undead. Any being killed (or drained below level 0) by a specter becomes a specter himself—a pitiful thrall to its creator.

### **Spider, Giant**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 2+2

Attacks: Bite (See below)

Special: See below

Move: 18

HDE/XP: 5/240

Giant spiders are aggressive hunters. Only the greater giant spiders are web builders. Giant spider webs require a saving throw to avoid becoming stuck. Those who make their saving throw can fight and move (5 feet per round) in the webs. Giant spiders surprise on a roll of 1–5, being able to hide well in shadows. A giant spider’s bite is very poisonous.

### **Treant**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 7–12

Attacks: Strike

Special: Control trees

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 7/600; 8/800; 9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700; 12/2,000

Treants are tree-like protectors and “shepherds” of forest trees. Depending upon their size, they have different hit dice and damage; treants of 7 to 8 hit dice inflict 2d6 points of damage with each strike of their branch-like hands, treants of 9–10 hit dice inflict 3d6 points, and treants of 11–12 hit dice inflict 4d6 points. All treants can “wake” trees within 60 feet, allowing them to walk at a rate of 3, and possibly to attack (no more than two trees at a time can be awake at the behest of a single treant).

### **Troll**
Armor Class: 4 [15]

Hit Dice: 6+3

Attacks: Claw

Special: Regeneration

Move: 12

HDE/XP: 8/800

Trolls are as tall as ogres and just as strong. Unlike ogres, however, they attack with claws and teeth instead of weapons. Trolls regenerate, which is to say that any damage inflicted upon them heals within minutes (3 hit points per round). The only way to utterly kill a troll is to submerse it in acid or burn it. Trolls can even re-grow lopped-off heads and limbs.

### **Unicorn**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 4

Attacks: Hoof or horn

Special: See below

Move: 24

HDE/XP: 5/240

Unicorns are generally shy and benevolent creatures, who will only allow a chaste maiden to approach them. They can teleport once per day to a distance of 360 feet, with a rider. When they charge, their horn can deal double damage. Unicorns are 25% resistant to magic. The unicorn’s horn has healing properties according to legend (the details of this, if any, are left to the Referee). There is considerable room to create variants of sorts: evil or flying unicorns, etc.

### **Vampire**
Armor Class: 2 [17]

Hit Dice: 7–9

Attacks: Bite (See below)

Special: See below

Move: 12/18 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 9/1,100; 10/1,400; 11/1,700

Vampires are some of the most powerful of undead creatures. They can only be hit with magic weapons and when “killed” in this way they change into a gaseous form, returning to their coffins.

They regenerate at a rate of 3 hit points per round, can turn into gaseous form or into a giant bat at will, and can summon a horde of bats or 3d6 wolves out from the night. Looking into a vampire’s eyes necessitates a saving throw at -2, or the character is charmed (as per the spell Charm Person). Most terrifyingly, a vampire’s bite drains two levels from the victim. 

Fortunately, vampires have some weaknesses. They can be killed (these are the only known methods) by immersing them in running water, exposing them to sunlight, or driving a wooden stake through the heart. They retreat from the smell of garlic, the sight of a mirror, or the sight of “good” holy symbols. Any human killed by a vampire becomes a vampire under the control of its creator. This description will be recognized easily as the “Dracula” type of vampire. 

Many other possibilities for vampires exist in folklore: Chinese vampires, for instance, and blood-drinkers more feral than intelligent. Plus, other cultural templates with different attributes could be created—how about an ancient Egyptian mummified vampire, or an Aztec vampire?

### **Wight**
Armor Class: 5 [14]

Hit Dice: 3

Attacks: Claw (See below)

Special: See below

Move: 9

HDE/XP: 5/240

Wights live in tombs, graveyards, and burial mounds (barrows). They are undead, and thus not affected by sleep or charm spells. Wights are immune to all non-magical weapons, with the exception of silver weapons. Any human killed or completely drained of levels (1 level per hit) by a wight becomes a wight.

### **Worg**
Armor Class: 6 [13]

Hit Dice: 4

Attacks: Bite

Special: None

Move: 18

HDE/XP: 4/120

Worgs are large, intelligent, and evil wolves of chaos. They are sometimes ridden by orcs. They may have supernatural origins.

### **Wraith**
Armor Class: 3 [16]

Hit Dice: 4

Attacks: Touch (See below)

Special: See below

Move: 24

HDE/XP: 6/400

Wraiths are powerful wights, immune to all non-magical weapons other than silver ones (which inflict only half damage). Arrows are particularly ineffective against them, for even magical and silver arrows inflict only one hit point of damage per hit. They drain 1 level per hit. Wraiths can be found riding well-trained battle steeds or more unusual mounts that will tolerate their presence.

### **Wyvern**
Armor Class: 3 [16]

Hit Dice: 7

Attacks: Bite or sting

Special: Flight, poison sting

Move: 6/24 (when flying)

HDE/XP: 9/1,100

A wyvern is the two-legged form of dragon, and these creatures are smaller and less intelligent than true four-legged dragons, not to mention that they do not have a breath weapon. Wyverns have a poisonous sting at the end of their tails, but they are not coordinated enough to attack with both bite and sting in a single round. In any given round, the wyvern is 60% likely to use its tail, which can lash out to the creature’s front even farther than its head can reach.

### **Yellow Mold**
Armor Class: N/A

Hit Dice: N/A

Attacks: See below

Special: Poisonous spores

Move: 0

HDE/XP: 3/60

Yellow mold is a subterranean fungus; it neither moves nor attacks. However, if it is poked or struck, it may (50% chance) release a cloud of poisonous spores, roughly 10 feet in diameter. Failing a saving throw against the spores means that the character dies a rather horrible death. Touching yellow mold causes 1d6 points of acid damage. These growths can be destroyed with fire.

### **Zombie**
Armor Class: 8 [11], 7 [12] w/ shield

Hit Dice: 1

Attacks: Strike or weapon

Special: Immune to sleep, charm

Move: 6

HDE/XP: 2/30

Zombies are mindless creatures, the walking dead. These are merely animated corpses, not carriers of any sort of undead contagion as ghouls are. If their undeath is contagious, they should be worth a few more experience points than described here, and if a single hit from a zombie causes contagion or any other sort of disease they should be worth considerably more experience. However, the standard zombie is simply a corpse animated to do its creator’s bidding.

### **Tougher Monsters**
There is really no limit as to how high monsters can go, and often it’s fun to trick the players by throwing über-monsters at them. The Referee should feel free to adjust AC, HD, or other factors to make monsters more challenging. Also, feel free to try new options like a super strain of orcs, goblin spider-riders, or fire-resistant mummies just to keep the players on their toes.

### **Monster Levels**
You may notice that while suggested character levels are capped, monster levels are not. The reasons for this are simple:

1. Players run in packs and big monsters need levels to overcome a disadvantage in numbers.
1. Players tend to be creative while many Referees allow monsters to “play stupid.”

The Referee has the option of allowing characters to continue to advance, or to put a cap on monster levels as he or she sees fit.

###### **Creating Monsters**
Monsters are not Player Characters, and their abilities are not at all determined by the rules for PCs—not even the stats for races that can have player characters, such as Dwarves. A monster’s abilities are determined by the Referee, not by any rules! Feel free to add wings, breath weapons, extra hit dice, wounded versions, or whatever suits your adventure and your campaign. Toggle and tweak, imagine and invent! You are responsible for the quality of the swords and sorcery in your game, not the rules. So don’t try to create monsters according to any sort of power formula. Create monsters based on how they feel and how they play at the gaming table. Create challenges for the players, not headaches for yourself. Your job is to imagine and create, not to slave at rulebooks finding out what you’re “allowed” to do.

## **Chapter 9**
**Treasure**

The amount of treasure a monster owns or guards is usually related to the monster’s HDE. That’s not necessarily realistic, but keep in mind that treasure is one of the ways the game reflects what a character has done: it’s used in awarding experience points. Too many large treasures and the characters will become powerful without actually having done very much. Too many monsters with small treasures and the characters won’t gain levels to reflect their achievements.

As a general guideline, the monetary value of a treasure ought to be about 2–3 times the monster’s value in experience points, and keep in mind that hunting and patrolling monsters likely won’t be carting their treasure around with them. If the characters can’t find the monster’s lair, they may get none of the treasure. Also, it obviously doesn’t make sense for every wild boar and wolf to have a cache of treasure hidden away somewhere. Averaging the treasure out over several of the monsters in an adventure is a good way of making sure the characters get the right amount of experience points from treasure. Perhaps the goblin treasure hoard contains some “extra” treasure to account for the wolves in the area. If the characters avoid the wolves and kill the goblins, so much the better. If they have to fight the wolves and never find the goblins, then the treasure is there for them to find next time.

Here is a table a Referee can use as a guideline to help create a treasure:

### **Treasure Values Table**

|**Roll**|**Possible Treasure Value (gp)\***|
| :-: | :-: |
||**Value**|**CP**|**SP**|**GP**|
|1|XP × 1|50%|30%|20%|
|2–3|XP × 2|20%|50%|30%|
|4–5|XP × 3|10%|40%|50%|
|6|XP × 4|–|25%|75%|
\* The total value of treasure is expressed in terms of gold coins. If the total value of treasure was 100 XP on a roll of 1, the recipient would receive 20 gp, 300 sp, and 5,000 cp

Remember that coins found are not always gold pieces—there might be a mixture of copper (cp) and silver pieces (sp) in the treasure as well. The treasure breakdown given in the prior Treasure Values table is a suggested guideline to how you might consider breaking up the treasure. One gold piece (gp) is worth 10 silver pieces (sp) or 100 copper pieces (cp).

**Splitting the Take (Variant)**

Once the monsters are slain and the wounds are bound, it’s time to divide up the treasure. It is suggested that the total gp value of the loot is totaled and divided up among the participants with each getting an equal “share.” Many Referees rule that treasure must be shared with NPCs getting either a full or half share, depending upon their level. It is also customary for fallen (dead) comrades to still get a share of the take to be given to their next of kin.

### **Treasure Items**
In addition to coins, treasures might contain gems, jewelry, and magical items. Treasures should be interesting—an endless series of “another treasure worth 100 gp in total” is a sure-fire recipe for boring your players.

For every 5,000 gp in value, there is a 10% chance of trading out 5,000 gp for an item on either the Major Gem/Jewelry or Major Magic table.

For every 1,000 gp in value, there is a 10% chance of trading out 1,000 gp for an item on either the Medium Gem/Jewelry or Medium Magic table.

For every 100 gp in value, there is a 10% chance of trading out 100 gp for an item on either the Minor Gem/Jewelry or Minor Magic table.

Calculate the total percentage of treasure that can be traded out and roll a d100 to see if you can roll for an item on one of the following tables. It is suggested that the Referee begin with the 5,000 gp values and work down to the 100 gp values. “Jewelry” refers to a single item of jewelry.

Always remember that these tables are merely guidelines—if you desire the placement of a particular item or treasure type, go ahead and do it! If you don’t wish to include gems, jewelry, or magic items, then leave the treasure at coins. These tables are here only to help when wanted.

**Treasure Trade Out (Example #1)**

If you populate an area with 5 skeletons, their total XP value would be 75. If you were to roll against the Treasure Values table and get a 4, the total treasure value for that encounter would be (rounded down): 112 gp, 900 sp, and 2,250 cp. There is a 10% chance of trading out 100 gp of that treasure for one minor item. If, on a d100, you roll under 10%, then the treasure value of that encounter would be 12 gp, 900 sp, 2,250 cp, and one minor item (as rolled on the Minor Gem/Jewelry or Minor Magic table).

**Treasure Trade Out (Example #2)**

You place a fearsome minotaur in a locked dungeon room for a total of 400 XP. Rolling against the Treasure Values table, if you were to roll a 6, the total treasure value for this encounter would be: 1,200 gp and 4,000 sp. There is a 10% chance of trading out 1,000 gp of that treasure for one medium item. If, on a d100, you roll under 10%, then the treasure value on that encounter would be 200 gp, 4,000 sp, and one medium item (as rolled on the Medium Gem/Jewelry or Medium Magic table). With the remaining gold, there could either be a 60% chance to trade out 600 gp for one minor item, six 10% chances to trade out 600 gp for a total of six minor items, or some other variant like one 10% chance to trade out 100 gp for one minor item (keeping the remaining 500 gp).

**5,000 gp Trade Out**

A roll of 1–19 on a d20 means a roll on the Major Gem/Jewelry table. A roll of 20 results in rolling on the Major Magic Item table.

### **Greater Ring Descriptions**

**Djinn Summoning:** The wearer of this ring can summon a djinn.

**Human Control:** Allows the wearer to cast Charm Person once per day and maintain the charm on up to 3 individuals at a time.

**Regeneration:** The wearer regenerates 1 HP/round and thus cannot die unless the ring is removed or the body burned.

**Shooting Stars:** Once per day, this ring can summon 1d6 flaming meteors from the depths of space. Each meteor can target a separate enemy and deals 3d6 damage. If used indoors or underground, the meteors will strike whatever is directly above the target.

**Spell Storing (Magic-user):** The ring contains 1d6 Magic-user spells. Roll 1d6 for each spell to determine their spell levels. The wearer (if a Magic-user) can cast these spells as if they were his own memorized and prepared spells. Once the spell is cast, it cannot be cast a second time until the caster rests for 8 hours.

**Spell Storing (Cleric):** The ring contains 1d6 Cleric spells. Roll 1d6 for each spell to determine their spell levels.

**Spell Turning:** Any spell (other than from a wand, etc.) directly aimed at the wearer of this ring is partially reflected back at the caster. Roll a d100 to determine how much of the spell’s power bounces back; the exact determination of what happens is up to the Referee.

**Telekinesis:** The wearer can mentally lift and move up to 200 pounds of weight at a range of 120 feet.

**Three Wishes:** Grants the wearer 3 wishes; outrageous wishes backfire.

### **Staff Descriptions**

**Absorption:** Absorbs spells cast directly at the wielder and allows the wielder to cast a spell from his own memory using that power (and thus not losing the spell from memory). Once the staff has absorbed 50 levels of spells (whether or not the power has been cast back out again), it no longer absorbs spells.

**Beguiling:** Casts Charm Person in a radius of 20 feet from the wielder (uses one charge). The duration of the charm is 1 hour.

**Command:** A charge can be used to control humans (as per Charm Person), plants, or animals.

**Healing:** Cures 1d6+1 hit points of damage per charge.

**Power:** Casts Light (no charge used), casts Fireball (4d6 damage), cold as a Wand of Cold, Lightning Bolt (4d6 damage), acts as a ring of Telekinesis (costs one charge) and hits for 2d6 damage (no charge used).

**Lordly Might:** These staves only carry 10 charges, but a charge may be used to cast Raise Dead.

**Snake, the:** +1 “to-hit” and +1 damage. When commanded (by using a charge) the staff coils around the target with a successful hit and pinions the victim for 1d4 × 10 minutes. The victim must be about the size of a human or smaller to use this power. The staff will slither back to its owner afterwards at a speed of 24. Only Clerics can employ a Staff of the Snake.

**Striking:** Inflicts 2d6 points of damage with a successful hit (does not use charges).

**Withering:** Adds ten years of physical aging with a successful hit.

**Wizardry:** The most powerful of staves. It is a staff of power with additional abilities. At the cost of one charge, it allows invisibility, summoning elementals (calling 1d4 at a time), Hold Person, a Wall of Fire, Passwall, a Web spell, or Fly.

### **Miscellaneous Magic Item Descriptions**

**Amulet against Scrying:** Protects the wearer from all scrying, such as Detect Thoughts or being viewed through a crystal ball. Usable by: All Classes.

**Amulet of Demon Control:** Functions as a Protection from Chaos spell, and allows the wearer to attempt to cast Charm Monster upon a demon. Success means that the demon is enslaved for 1d6 weeks, whereupon it becomes free. Usable by: Magic-users and Clerics.

**Arrow of Direction:** Points the direction of whatever the owner requests. Cannot be used more than 7 times in a single week. Usable by: All Classes.

**Bag of Holding:** The inside of this bag is larger than the outside. The inside dimensions are roughly 10 × 5 × 3 feet, but the bag cannot carry more than 1,000 pounds of weight.

**Beaker of Potions:** This small jug fills itself with the requested potion, out of the 1d4+1 potions it is able to produce. The jug can be used as many times per week as it can create potions. Usable by: All Classes.

**Boots of Elvenkind:** The wearer moves with complete silence. Usable by: All Classes.

**Boots of Levitation:** These boots allow the wearer to Levitate (as per the spell) with unlimited duration. Usable by: All Classes.

**Boots of Speed or Boots of Leaping (50%):** Boots of Speed double the wearer’s movement rate, but require complete rest for a period of time equivalent to the amount of time they were used. Boots of Leaping allow the wearer to make prodigious leaps 10 feet high and up to 30 feet horizontally. These boots also double movement rates, but outdoors only. They do not require the wearer to rest a fter using them. Usable by: All Classes.

**Bracers of Defense, AC 4 [15] or AC 2 [17] (50% chance):** These bracers improve the wearer’s armor class (whatever part of it is due to actual armor) to the stated level—there is no effect if the wearer is already armored to the same or higher degree. The AC granted by the bracers can be increased by magical rings or other protective magics. Usable by: All Classes.

**Bracers of Defense, AC 6 [13]:** These bracers improve the wearer’s armor class (whatever part of it is due to actual armor) to the stated level—there is no effect if the wearer is already armored to the same or higher degree. The AC granted by the bracers can be increased by magical rings or other protective magics. Usable by: All Classes.

**Carpet of Flying:** The carpet can carry as many as three people, and travels at a speed of 18 when it has more than one passenger. With only one rider, the carpet moves at a rate of 30. Usable by: All Classes.

**Censer, Bowl, Brazier, or Stone of Controlling Elementals:** Censers control air elementals, bowls (when filled) control water elementals, braziers control fire elementals, and Stones control earth elementals. These items can be used to summon a 12 HD elemental of the appropriate type. Generally, it takes 10 minutes to prepare the object for use. Usable by: Magic-users.

**Chime of Opening:** Sounding this small chime opens any door, even if the door is barred or Wizard Locked. Usable by: All Classes.

**Cloak of Displacement:** The wearer appears to be in a slightly different location than he really is. His AC improves by 2, and he gains a +2 saving throw against any targeted attack upon him. Usable by: All Classes.

**Cloak of Elvenkind:** The wearer is almost, but not quite, invisible. Usable by: All Classes.

**Cloak of Protection, +1:** This cloak improves the wearer’s AC by 1, and grants a bonus of +1 on saving throws. Usable by: All but Fighters.

**Cloak of Protection, +2 or +3 (50%):** This cloak improves the wearer’s armor class by 2 (or 3), and grants a bonus of +2 (or +3) on saving throws. Usable by: All but Fighters.

**Crystal Ball:** Allows the user to see what he desires to see, over a considerable distance. A crystal ball may not be used more than thrice per day, or the user will be driven mad. Certain spells and other precautions may be used to prevent being seen through a crystal ball. Some crystal balls communicate sound or even thoughts from the area being scryed, although these are rare. Usable by: Magic-users.

**Cursed Item:** (See Cursed Items, Page 104)

**Decanter of Endless Water:** This jug pours out one gallon of water per minute when unstoppered. Usable by: All Classes.

**Deck of Many Things:** An ordinary-seeming deck of hand-painted cards, this item bears tremendous and varied enchantments, one per card in the deck. The deck contains all the aces and face cards, plus one Joker (the Fool). A character may draw as many cards as he likes (with the deck re-shuffled each time), but once he stops drawing cards, the deck disappears in a sound of faintly malevolent laughter. The results are as follows:

The Hearts (♥)

Ace: Gain 50,000 xp.

King: Gain a magic item from the Misc. Magic Items (Greater) table.

Queen: Gain 1d3 wishes

Jack: Gain the ability to summon an 8 HD warrior with +3 sword, shield, to serve for a total of 1 hour.

The Clubs (♣)

Ace: The character’s alignment is changed. If the game does not use alignment, the character receives a dangerous Quest (per the spell).

King: The character’s most powerful magic item is sucked into the void and disappears.

Queen: The character is instantly turned to stone, a look of great surprise upon his face.

Jack: The character loses one point from his Prime Attribute.

The Spades (♠)

Ace: Lose a level of experience

King: A warrior with 9 HD, a +4 weapon, +4 shield, and +4 armor appears and attacks. When he is killed, his body and all his possessions disappear again.

Queen: The character dies instantly.

Jack: A random monster, with 1d4+6 HD, attacks the adventurers. The monster gains one round of surprise, for it appears from thin air.

The Diamonds (♦)

Ace: Gain a map to a very significant treasure

King: Gain 5d6 items of jewelry

Queen: Gain a scroll of seven spells, all 2nd level or higher

The Joker: Gain 25,000 XP or choose to draw two more cards.

**Dust of Appearance or Disappearance (50%):** Dust of Appearance is tossed in a radius of 10 feet around the user, and makes any invisible, astral, displaced, out-of-phase, or dimensional thing completely visible. The dust generally comes in a pouch, with enough for 20–30 uses. Dust of Disappearance works in the opposite way: when it is sprinkled in a 10 foot radius, everything therein becomes invisible for 5d6 turns. Normal means of detecting invisibility (such as a Detect Invisibility spell) are not strong enough to work against the dust’s powerful enchantment. Usable by: All Classes.

**Dust of Sneezing and Choking:** Pouches containing this dust ordinarily contain only enough for one “dose.” When scattered in a radius of 10 feet, the dust causes all in the area to make a saving throw or die. If the nature of the dust is identified before it is experimented with, it can be used as a devastating thrown weapon. Usable by: All Classes.

**Efreeti Bottle:** The efreeti of the bottle will serve the bottle’s owner for a year and a day unless it is accidentally released from servitude. Usable by: All Classes.

**Figurine of the Golden Lions:** A small stone figurine that transforms into a lion when the command word is spoken, fighting at the owner’s orders. If they are slain, they turn back into figurines, but may be used again. The figurine may be used once per week, and no more. Usable by: All Classes.

**Figurine of the Onyx Dog:** This stone figure transforms into a living hound of stone when its command word is spoken. It will seek whatever the owner tells it to find, without stopping until it succeeds or is killed. It has a 75% chance to detect objects that are invisible or hidden (and of course its sense of smell detects invisible and hidden creatures with almost perfect success). For purposes of defense and attack, the stone dog is treated as a wolf. It may be used twelve times before the statuette becomes non-magical. Usable by: All Classes.

**Gauntlets of Dexterity:** When worn, these gloves grant a bonus of +2 to the wearer’s dexterity (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Gauntlets of Ogre Power:** These gauntlets raise the wearer’s strength to that of an ogre. Hit probability is not increased above normal, but damage bonuses from strength are increased to +4 (not cumulative with the wearer’s existing strength bonus, if any). Usable by: all but Magic-users.

**Gauntlets of Swimming and Climbing:** These gloves permit the wearer to swim at a rate of 18, and climb sheer walls with a 95% chance of success per ten feet of climbing. Usable by: all but Magic-users.

**Gem of Seeing:** A gem of seeing is used as a lens, and shows the truth of what it sees, cutting through illusions of all kinds, even very powerful ones. Usable by: All Classes.

**Girdle of Giant Strength:** This wide belt grants the wearer the strength of a hill giant (+8 strength damage, not cumulative with any existing strength bonuses). It does not increase “to-hit” probability. Usable by: All Classes.

**Helm of Fiery Brilliance:** This prodigiously powerful helm grants many benefits to the wearer. He gains a +10 on saving throws against fire damage, and can create a Wall of Fire himself. Fighters wearing the helm may command a weapon in hand to flame (+1d6 damage). Magic-users wearing the helm can add +1 to each die of damage inflicted by a Fireball spell. Clerics wearing the helm can ignite objects within 30 feet at will, and may cast two Light or Continual Light spells for each one actually prepared. The wearer of this helm is likely to be attacked by any air elemental creatures, but fire elemental types (such as efreet or salamanders) will be favorably disposed toward the wearer. Usable by: All Classes.

**Helm of Reading Magic and Languages:** The wearer can read all languages, including magic script. Usable by: All Classes.

**Helm of Teleportation:** When the wearer casts a Teleportation spell on himself, while wearing the helm, he may teleport himself without error, anywhere he desires. The helm does not permit the casting of a Teleportation spell on anyone other than the wearer. Usable by: Magic-users.

**Hole, Portable:** A piece of dark cloth about five feet in diameter. It is actually the mouth of an inter-dimensional hole 10 feet deep—items and people can fall through it or climb down into it once it is placed on the ground. The piece of cloth can actually be pulled in from the inside to close the hole off entirely, although there is no source of fresh air within, and staying inside will asphyxiate the inhabitant in a short time. The piece of cloth can be picked up and carried off whenever desired—hence the name “portable.” Usable by: All Classes.

**Horn of Blasting:** This horn, when blown, has the same effect on structures as a catapult, and causes 2d6 points of damage to creatures, deafening them for 10 minutes as well. The cone of sound is 100 feet long, and widens to a base of 20 feet (the “point” of the cone, at the horn’s mouth, is 10 feet wide). Usable by: All Classes.

**Horn of Valhalla, Bronze:** Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (3 HD) to assist the one who winded the horn. Usable by: Fighters and Clerics only.

**Horn of Valhalla, Iron:** Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (4 HD) to assist the one who winded the horn. Usable by: Fighters.

**Horn of Valhalla, Silver:** Summons 2d4 berserk warriors (2 HD) to assist the one who winded the horn. Usable by: All Classes.

**Horseshoes of Speed:** Double a horse’s movement rate. Usable by: Horses.

**Jug of Alchemy:** This jug produces whatever liquid is desired, in a commonly used large quantity (e.g., 10 gallons of water, but only five gallons of wine). It may be used no more than 7 times per day, and will only produce the liquid first requested in that day. It does not produce magical liquids. Usable by: All Classes.

**Lenses of Charming:** These lenses, when placed over the eyes, give the wearer the ability to charm those who look into his eyes (as per a Charm Person spell). The saving throw against the power of the lenses is made at -2. Usable by: All Classes.

**Libram, magical (level gain):** Magical librams grant a level of experience to the reader, if the reader is of the right class. Randomly determine the class for which the libram is written.

**Luckstone:** This stone grants +1 to saving throws and “to-hit” rolls. Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Beneficial Exercise:** Reading this tome increases the reader’s strength by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Golems:** This book contains the basic instructions and formulae for creating a single type of golem. The process is expensive, and the creator must have achieved a certain level of magical expertise in order to use the book, but these are priceless repositories of forgotten lore. Such books are often warded, by the original owner, from the touch of anyone not of the Magic-user class, enchanted to inflict damage or even the loss of a level. Usable by: Magic-users only.

**Manual of Intelligence:** Reading this tome increases the reader’s intelligence by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Quickness:** Reading this tome increases the reader’s dexterity by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Manual of Wisdom:** Reading this tome increases the reader’s wisdom by 1 point (to a maximum of 18). Usable by: All Classes.

**Medallion of Detect Thoughts (ESP):** Functions as a Detect Thoughts (ESP) spell within 30 feet (75%) or 90 feet (25%). Usable by: All Classes.

**Mirror of Mental Scrying:** This hand-mirror (it might also be found as a smaller mirror on a necklace) allows the user to cast Clairaudience, Clairvoyance, and Detect Thoughts (ESP), with the normal range, but for an unlimited time. The mirror will also answer a question about what it portrays (the answer is likely to be quite cryptic), but only one question per week is possible. Usable by: All Classes.

**Necklace of Fireballs:** This necklace is hung with 3d4 little baubles. When thrown, the baubles explode into 6d6 fireballs (per the spell). Usable by: All Classes.

**Pipes of the Sewers:** These pipes summon 10d6 giant rats. The piper does not need to concentrate once the rats arrive (which takes 1d4 × 10 minutes), but it is wise to do so. When the rats arrive, there is a 5% chance that they will not obey him, and if he ceases to concentrate on his tune there is a 10% chance that he will lose control of them. Every subsequent round in which he fails to concentrate there is another chance to lose control, and the chance increases by 10% each time it is made (first round, 10%, second round 20%, etc.). Usable by: All Classes.

**Robe of Blending:** These robes make the wearer appear to be a part of his surroundings, including the ability to appear as another one of a group of nearby creatures. He will appear to be a small tree when in forest surroundings, a sand formation in the desert, etc. Creatures with 10+ hit dice (or levels of experience) have a 10% chance per level (or HD) above 9th to perceive the wearer as a robed figure rather than a part of the surroundings. Usable by: All Classes.

**Robe of Eyes:** Hundreds of eyes are woven and embroidered into the fabric of these magical robes, granting the wearer tremendous powers of supernatural perception. In a radius of 240 feet, anything he looks upon is seen for what it is: he sees invisible creatures, he perceives illusions, and his sight even extends into the astral plane. He cannot be ambushed or otherwise taken by surprise, and he can follow the trail of anything that has passed by within the last day. Usable by: Magic-users only.

**Robe of Wizardry:** This robe grants the wearer the ability to cast Charm, Polymorph, and Hold Person with a 95% chance of success. The robes may be tied to specific alignments. Usable by: Magic-users only.

**Rope of Climbing:** A 50 foot length of rope that leaps magically upward and can tie and untie itself upon command. Usable by: All Classes.

**Rope of Entanglement:** This rope, on command, twines itself around as many as 2d4+1 human-sized foes. The rope cannot be hit except with a natural roll of 20 (it is magical), and can sustain 20 hit points of damage before fraying and becoming useless. Usable by: All Classes.

**Spade of Excavation:** This ordinary-looking spade digs by itself when commanded, shoveling out 1 cubic yard (27 cubic feet) per ten minutes. Usable by: Fighters.

**Symbol—Scarab of Insanity:** This is a carving of a scarab-beetle, or perhaps the petrified remains of a real one. When the scarab is displayed, all creatures with 9 or fewer hit dice, within a radius of 30 feet, fall into temporary insanity lasting for 2 hours. Creatures with 10+ hit dice still do not receive a saving throw, but have a 1 in 4 chance to overcome the scarab’s insidious influence. The scarab may be used 12 times, after which it crumbles to dust. At the option of the Referee, it might be recharged but with a 5% chance per charge that the item will be destroyed. Usable by: All Classes.

### **Cursed Items**
Cursed items come in many shapes and forms—most likely they are ancient magical items whose magic has deteriorated or changed with age, although some of them were clearly fashioned to serve as traps for the unwary (or for the maker’s enemies, perhaps). Note that cursed items cannot usually be dropped or removed without the assistance of a Remove Curse spell. Although the Referee is encouraged to create his own cursed items, the samples on the following page should prove useful guidance:

### **Cursed Item Descriptions**

**Bag of Devouring:*** Functions as a bag of holding, but devours any item placed into it within 1d4+1 hours.

**Censer of Hostile Elementals:** A censer (or brazier, bowl, or stone) that summons elementals—but the elementals are hostile instead of under the summoner’s control.

**Cloak of Poison:** Upon donning this cloak, the wearer’s body is suffused with magical poisons of many kinds, and dies instantly, without the chance of a saving throw.

**Crystal Ball of Suggestion:** Does not function as a crystal ball, but implants a suggestion in the viewer’s mind. Powerful versions of this item might even implant a Quest.

**Dancing Boots:** These boots function as boots of Elvenkind or speed, until the wearer is in combat or fleeing. Suddenly at that point he will begin to dance a jig, or perhaps a stately waltz.

**Flask of Stoppered Curses:** This flask releases a curse of some kind when its seal is broken.

**Horn of Collapse:** When sounded, this horn causes a blast of destruction straight upwards, destroying any ceiling overhead and causing it to collapse.

**Medallion of Projecting Thoughts:** The wearer’s thoughts can be “heard” by all nearby.

**Mirror of Opposition:** All persons looking into this mirror are attacked by evil versions of themselves, exact duplicates including spells and magic items. When the mirror-opposites are slain, their bodies and equipment disappear into mist, and return to the mirror.

**Robe of Feeblemindedness:** Anyone donning this cloak has his intelligence reduced to that of a garden snail.
