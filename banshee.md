Banshees are horrid fey (or undead)
creatures that live in swamps and
other desolate places. They can only
be harmed by magical or silver weap-
ons. Banshees have a 49% resistance
to magic, and they are immune to
enchantments. Their shriek (once
per day) necessitates a saving throw
versus death or the hearer will die in
2d6 rounds. They can travel over wa-
ter and other terrain as if it were land,
but crossing running water causes it
to lose its magic resistance for 3d6
hours. They look like gaunt humans
with long, stringy hair and glowing
yellow eyes. They often wear hooded
cloaks. At the Refereeâ€™s discretion,
such creatures might be undead rath-
er than faerie-folk, and are considered
to have 9 HD for turning purposes.
