These terrible undead knights are clad
in black armor and wield terrible two-

In addition to increased damage,
each time a death knight successfully
strikes a foe with their sword the tar-
get loses one level.   
Death Knights are also immune to all spells of 5th level
or lower. They can cast a Fireball once
per day that inflicts 7d6 points of
damage. They are immune to damage
from mundane weapons and cannot
be banished by a cleric.
